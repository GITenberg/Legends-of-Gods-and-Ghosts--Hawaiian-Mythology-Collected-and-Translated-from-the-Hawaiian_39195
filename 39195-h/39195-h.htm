<p>Readers will have little difficulty in pronouncing names
if they remember <i>two</i> rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. No syllable ends in a consonant, <i>e.g.</i>, Ho-no-lu-lu,
not Hon-o-lulu.</p>

<p>2. Give vowels the German sound rather than the
English, <i>e.g.</i>, "e" equals "a," and "i" equals "e," and
"a" is sounded like "a" in "father."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The legends of the Hawaiian Islands are as
diverse as those of any country in the world.
They are also entirely distinct in form and
thought from the fairy-tales which excite the
interest and wonder of the English and German
children. The mythology of Hawaii follows the
laws upon which all myths are constructed.
The Islanders have developed some beautiful
nature-myths. Certain phenomena have been
observed and the imagination has fitted the
story to the interesting object which has attracted
attention.</p>

<p>Now the Rainbow Maiden of Manoa, a valley
lying back of Honolulu, is the story of a princess
whose continual death and resurrection were
invented to harmonize with the formation of a
series of exquisite rainbows which are born on
the mountain-sides in the upper end of the valley
and die when the mist clouds reach the plain
into which the valley opens. Then there were
the fish of the Hawaiian Islands which vie with
the butterflies of South America in their multitudinous
combinations of colors. These im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>aginative
people wondered how the fish were
painted, so for a story a battle between two
chiefs was either invented or taken as a basis.
The chiefs fought on the mountain-sides until
finally one was driven into the sea and compelled
to make the deep waters his continual
abiding-place. Here he found a unique and
pleasant occupation in calling the various kinds
of fish to his submarine home and then painting
them in varied hues according to the dictates
of his fancy. Thus we have a pure nature-myth
developed from the love of the beautiful, one
of the highest emotions dwelling in the hearts
of the Hawaiians of the long ago.</p>

<p>So, again, Maui, a wonder-working hero like
the Hercules of Grecian mythology, heard the
birds sing, and noted their beautiful forms as
they flitted from tree to tree and mingled their
bright plumage with the leaves of the fragrant
blossoms.</p>

<p>No other one of those who lived in the long
ago could see what Maui saw. They heard the
mysterious music, but the songsters were invisible.
Many were the fancies concerning
these strange creatures whom they could hear
but could not see. Maui finally pitied his friends
and made the birds visible. Ever since, man has
been able to both hear the music and see the
beauty of his forest neighbors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Such nature-myths as these are well worthy of
preservation by the side of any European fairy-tale.
In purity of thought, vividness of imagination,
and delicacy of coloring the Hawaiian
myths are to be given a high place in literature
among the stories of nature vivified by the imagination.</p>

<p>Another side of Hawaiian folk-lore is just as
worthy of comparison. Lovers of "Jack-the-Giant-Killer,"
and of the other wonder-workers
dwelling in the mist-lands of other nations, would
enjoy reading the marvelous record of Maui,
the skilful demi-god of Hawaii, who went fishing
with a magic hook, and pulled up from the
depths of the ocean groups of islands. This
story is told in a matter-of-fact way, as if it were
a fishing-excursion only a little out of the ordinary
course. Maui lived in a land where volcanic
fires were always burning in the mountains.
Nevertheless it was a little inconvenient to walk
thirty or forty miles for a live coal after the cold
winds of the night had put out the fire which
had been carefully protected the day before.
Thus, when he saw that some intelligent birds
knew the art of making a fire, he captured the
leader and forced him to tell the secret of rubbing
certain sticks together until fire came.</p>

<p>Maui also made snares, captured the sun and
compelled it to journey regularly and slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
across the heavens. Thus the day was regulated
to meet the wants of mankind. He lifted the
heavens after they had rested so long upon all
the plants that their leaves were flat.</p>

<p>There was a ledge of rock in one of the rivers,
so Maui uprooted a tree and pushed it through,
making an easy passage for both water and man.
He invented many helpful articles for the use of
mankind, but meanwhile frequently filled the
days of his friends with trouble on account of
the mischievous pranks which he played on
them.</p>

<p>Fairies and gnomes dwelt in the woodland,
coming forth at night to build temples, massive
walls, to fashion canoes, or whisper warnings.
The birds and the fishes were capable and intelligent
guardians over the households which had
adopted them as protecting deities. Birds of
brilliant plumage and sweet song were always
faithful attendants on the chiefs, and able to
converse with those over whom they kept watch.
Sharks and other mighty fish of the deep waters
were reliable messengers for those who rendered
them sacrifices, often carrying their devotees
from island to island and protecting them from
many dangers.</p>

<p>Sometimes the gruesome and horrible creeps
into Hawaiian folk-lore. A poison tree figures
in the legends and finally becomes one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
most feared of all the gods of Hawaii. A cannibal
dog, cannibal ghosts, and even a cannibal
chief are prominent among the noted characters
of the past.</p>

<p>Then the power of praying a person to death
with the aid of departed spirits was believed in,
and is at the present time.</p>

<p>Almost every valley of the island has its
peculiar and interesting myth. Often there is a
historical foundation which has been dealt with
fancifully and enlarged into miraculous proportions.
There are hidden caves, which can be
entered only by diving under the great breakers
or into the deep waters of inland pools, around
which cluster tales of love and adventure.</p>

<p>There are many mythological characters whose
journeys extend to all the islands of the group.
The Maui stories are not limited to the large
island Hawaii and a part of the adjoining island
which bears the name of Maui, but these stories
are told in a garbled form on all the islands. So
Pele, the fire-goddess, who dwelt in the hottest
regions of the most active volcanoes, belongs to
all, and also Kamapuaa, who is sometimes her
husband, but more frequently her enemy. The
conflicts between the two are often suggested
by destructive lava flows checked by storms or
ocean waves. It cannot be suspected that the
ancient Hawaiian had the least idea of deifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
fire and water&mdash;and yet the continual conflict
between man and woman is like the eternal
enmity between the two antagonistic elements of
nature.</p>

<p>When the borders of mist-land are crossed,
a rich store of folk-lore with a historical foundation
is discovered. Chiefs and gods mingle
together as in the days of the Nibelungen Lied.
Voyages are made to many distant islands of the
Pacific Ocean, whose names are frequently mentioned
in the songs and tales of the wandering
heroes. A chief from Samoa establishes a royal
family on the largest of the Hawaiian Islands,
and a chief from the Hawaiian group becomes a
ruler in Tahiti.</p>

<p>Indeed the rovers of the Pacific have tales of
seafaring which equal the accounts of the voyages
of the Vikings.</p>

<p>The legends of the Hawaiian Islands are valuable
in themselves, in that they reveal an understanding
of the phenomena of nature and unveil
their early history with its mythological setting.
They are also valuable for comparison with the
legends of the other Pacific islands, and they are
exceedingly interesting when contrasted with
the folk-lore of other nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<h2>I</h2>

<p class="center">THE GHOST OF WAHAULA TEMPLE</p>


<p>Hawaiian temples were never works of
art. Broken lava was always near the
site upon which a temple was to be built. Rough
unhewn stones were easily piled into massive
walls and laid in terraces for altar and floors.
Water-worn pebbles were carried from the nearest
beach and strewn over the uneven floor, making
a comparatively smooth place over which the
naked feet of the temple dwellers passed without
the injuries which would otherwise frequently
come from the sharp-edged lava. Rude grass
huts built on terraces were the abodes of the
priests and of the high chiefs who sometimes
visited the places of sacrifice. Elevated, flat-topped
piles of stones were usually built at one
end of the temple for the chief idols and the
sacrifices placed before them. Simplicity of
detail marked every step of temple erection.</p>

<p>No hewn pillars or arched gateways of even
the most primitive designs can be found in any
of the temples whether of recent date or belonging
to remote antiquity. There was no attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
at ornamentation even in the images of the great
gods which they worshipped. Crude, uncouth,
and hideous were the images before which they
offered sacrifice and prayer.</p>

<p>In themselves the heiaus, or temples, of the
Hawaiian Islands have but little attraction.
To-day they seem more like massive walled
cattle-pens than places which had ever been
used for sacred worship.</p>

<p>On the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii
near Kalapana is one of the largest, oldest, and
best preserved heiaus, or temples, in the Hawaiian
Islands. It is no exception to the architectural
rule for Hawaiian temples, and is worthy the
name of temple only as it is intimately associated
with the religious customs of the Hawaiians. Its
walls are several feet thick and in places ten to
twelve feet high. It is divided into rooms or
pens, in one of which still lies the huge sacrificial
stone upon which victims&mdash;sometimes human&mdash;were
slain before the bodies were placed as
offerings in front of the hideous idols leaning
against the stone walls.</p>

<p>This heiau now bears the name Wahaula, or
"red-mouth." In ancient times it was known as
Ahaula, or "the red assembly," possibly denoting
that at times the priests and their attendants
wore red mantles in their processions or during
some part of their sacred ceremonies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>This temple is said to be the oldest of all the
Hawaiian heiaus&mdash;except possibly the heiau at
Kohala on the northern coast of the same island.
These two heiaus date back in tradition to the
time of Paao, the priest from Upolu, Samoa, who
was said to have built them. He was the traditional
father of the priestly line which ran parallel
to the royal genealogy of the Kamehamehas
during several centuries until the last high priest,
Hewahewa, became a follower of Jesus Christ&mdash;the
Saviour of the world. This was the last
heiau destroyed when the ancient tabus and
ceremonial rites were overthrown by the chiefs
just before the coming of Christian missionaries.
At that time the grass houses of the priests were
burned and in these raging flames were thrown
the wooden idols back of the altars and the bamboo
huts of the soothsayers and the rude images
on the walls, with everything combustible which
belonged to the ancient order of worship. Only
the walls and rough stone floors were left in the
temple.</p>

<p>In the outer temple court was the most noted
sacred grave in all the islands. Earth had been
carried from the mountain-sides inland. Leaves
and decaying trees added to the permanency of
the soil. Here in a most unlikely place it was
said that all the varieties of trees then found in
the islands had been gathered by the priests&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>the
descendants of Paao. To this day the grave
stands by the temple walls, an object of superstitious
awe among the natives. Many of the
varieties of trees there planted have died, leaving
only those which were more hardy and needed
less priestly care than they received a hundred
years or more ago.</p>

<p>The temple is built near the coast on the rough,
sharp, broken rocks of an ancient lava flow. In
many places in and around the temple the lava
was dug out, making holes three or four feet across
and from one to two feet deep. These in the
days of the priesthood had been filled with earth
brought in baskets from the mountains. Here
they raised sweet potatoes and taro and bananas.
Now the rains have washed the soil away and
to the unknowing there is no sign of previous
agriculture. Near these depressions and along
the paths leading to Wahaula other holes were
sometimes cut out of the hard fine-grained lava.
When heavy rains fell, little grooves carried the
drops of water to these holes and they became
small cisterns. Here the thirsty messengers
running from one priestly clan to another, or
the traveller or worshippers coming to the sacred
place, could almost always find a few drops of
water to quench their thirst.</p>

<p>Usually these water-holes were covered with
a large flat stone under which the water ran into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the cistern. To this day these small water
places border the path across the pahoehoe lava
field which lies adjacent to the broken a-a lava
upon which the Wahaula heiau is built. Many
of them are still covered as in the days of the
long ago.</p>

<p>It is not strange that legends have developed
through the mists of the centuries around this
rude old temple.</p>

<p>Wahaula was a tabu temple of the very highest
rank. The native chants said,</p>

<p>"No keia heiau oia ke kapu enaena."</p>

<p>("Concerning this heiau is the burning tabu.")</p>

<p>"Enaena" means "burning with a red hot
rage." The heiau was so thoroughly "tabu," or
"kapu," that the smoke of its fires falling upon
any of the people or even upon any one of the
chiefs was sufficient cause for punishment by
death, with the body as a sacrifice to the gods
of the temple.</p>

<p>These gods were of the very highest rank
among the Hawaiian deities. Certain days were
tabu to Lono&mdash;or Rongo, as he was known in
other island groups of the Pacific Ocean. Other
days belonged to Ku&mdash;who was also worshipped
from New Zealand to Tahiti. At other times
Kane, known as Tane by many Polynesians,
was held supreme. Then again Kanaloa&mdash;or
Tanaroa, sometimes worshipped in Samoa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
other island groups as the greatest of all their
gods&mdash;had his days especially set apart for sacrifice
and chant.</p>

<p>The Mu, or "body-catcher," of this heiau
with his assistants seems to have been continually
on the watch for human victims, and woe to
the unfortunate man who carelessly or ignorantly
walked where the winds blew the smoke
from the temple fires. No one dared rescue him
from the hands of the hunter of men&mdash;for then
the wrath of all the gods was sure to follow him
all the days of his life.</p>

<p>The people of the districts around Wahaula
always watched the course of the winds with
great anxiety, carefully noting the direction
taken by the smoke. This smoke was the
shadow cast by the deity worshipped, and was
far more sacred than the shadow of the highest
chief or king in all the islands.</p>

<p>It was always sufficient cause for death if a
common man allowed his shadow to fall upon
any tabu chief, <i>i.e.</i>, a chief of especially high
rank; but in this "burning tabu," if any man
permitted the smoke or shadow of the god
who was being worshipped in this temple to
come near to him or overshadow him, it was a
mark of such great disrespect that the god was
supposed to be enaena, or red hot with rage.</p>

<p>Many ages ago a young chief whom we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
know by the name Kahele determined to take
an especial journey around the island visiting
all the noted and sacred places and becoming
acquainted with the alii, or chiefs, of the other
districts.</p>

<p>He passed from place to place, taking part
with the chiefs who entertained him sometimes
in the use of the papa-hee, or surf-board, riding
the white-capped surf as it majestically swept
shoreward&mdash;sometimes spending night after night
in the innumerable gambling contests which
passed under the name pili waiwai&mdash;and sometimes
riding the narrow sled, or holua, with which
Hawaiian chiefs raced down the steep grassed
lanes. Then again, with a deep sense of the
solemnity of sacred things, he visited the most
noted of the heiaus and made contributions to
the offerings before the gods. Thus the days
passed, and the slow journey was very pleasant
to Kahele.</p>

<p>In time he came to Puna, the district in which
was located the temple Wahaula.</p>

<p>But alas! in the midst of the many stories of
the past which he had heard, and the many
pleasures he had enjoyed while on his journey,
Kahele forgot the peculiar power of the tabu of
the smoke of Wahaula. The fierce winds of
the south were blowing and changing from
point to point. The young man saw the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
grove in the edge of which the temple walls
could be discerned. Thin wreaths of smoke were
tossed here and there from the temple fires.</p>

<p>Kahele hastened toward the temple. The Mu
was watching his coming and joyfully marking
him as a victim. The altars of the gods were
desolate, and if but a particle of smoke fell upon
the young man no one could keep him from
the hands of the executioner.</p>

<p>The perilous moment came. The warm
breath of one of the fires touched the young
chief's cheek. Soon a blow from the club of
the Mu laid him senseless on the rough stones
of the outer court of the temple. The smoke of
the wrath of the gods had fallen upon him, and
it was well that he should lie as a sacrifice upon
their altars.</p>

<p>Soon the body with the life still in it was
thrown across the sacrificial stone. Sharp
knives made from the strong wood of the bamboo
let his life-blood flow down the depressions across
the face of the stone. Quickly the body was
dismembered and offered as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>For some reason the priests, after the flesh
had decayed, set apart the bones for some
special purpose. The legends imply that the
bones were to be treated dishonorably. It may
have been that the bones were folded together
in the shape known as unihipili, or "grasshopper"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bones, <i>i.e.</i>, folded and laid away for purposes
of incantation. Such bundles of bones were
put through a process of prayers and charms
until at last it was thought a new spirit was
created which dwelt in that bundle and gave
the possessor a peculiar power in deeds of witchcraft.</p>

<p>The spirit of Kahele rebelled against this disposition
of all that remained of his body. He
wanted to be back in his native district, that
he might enjoy the pleasures of the Under-world
with his own chosen companions. Restlessly
the spirit haunted the dark corners of the temple,
watching the priests as they handled his bones.</p>

<p>Helplessly the ghost fumed and fretted against
its condition. It did all that a disembodied spirit
could do to attract the attention of the priests.</p>

<p>At last the spirit fled by night from this place
of torment to the home which he had so joyfully
left a short time before.</p>

<p>Kahele's father was the high chief of Kau.
Surrounded by retainers, he passed his days in
quietness and peace waiting for the return of
his son.</p>

<p>One night a strange dream came to him. He
heard a voice calling from the mysterious confines
of the spirit-land. As he listened, a spirit
form stood by his side. The ghost was that of
his son Kahele.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>By means of the dream the ghost revealed to
the father that he had been put to death and
that his bones were in great danger of dishonorable
treatment.</p>

<p>The father awoke benumbed with fear, realizing
that his son was calling upon him for immediate
help. At once he left his people and journeyed
from place to place secretly, not knowing where
or when Kahele had died, but fully sure that the
spirit of his vision was that of his son. It was
not difficult to trace the young man. He had
left his footprints openly all along the way.
There was nothing of shame or dishonor&mdash;and
the father's heart filled with pride as he hastened
on.</p>

<p>From time to time, however, he heard the
spirit voice calling him to save the bones of the
body of his dead son. At last he felt that his
journey was nearly done. He had followed the
footsteps of Kahele almost entirely around the
island, and had come to Puna&mdash;the last district
before his own land of Kau would welcome his
return.</p>

<p>The spirit voice could be heard now in the
dream which nightly came to him. Warnings
and directions were frequently given.</p>

<p>Then the chief came to the lava fields of
Wahaula and lay down to rest. The ghost
came to him again in a dream, telling him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
great personal danger was near at hand. The
chief was a very strong man, excelling in
athletic and brave deeds, but in obedience to the
spirit voice he rose early in the morning, secured
oily nuts from a kukui-tree, beat out the oil, and
anointed himself thoroughly.</p>

<p>Walking along carelessly as if to avoid suspicion,
he drew near to the lands of the temple
Wahaula. Soon a man came out to meet him.
This man was an Olohe, a beardless man belonging
to a lawless robber clan which infested the
district, possibly assisting the man-hunters of
the temple in securing victims for the temple
altars. This Olohe was very strong and self-confident,
and thought he would have but little
difficulty in destroying this stranger who journeyed
alone through Puna.</p>

<p>Almost all day the battle raged between the
two men. Back and forth they forced each
other over the lava beds. The chief's well-oiled
body was very difficult for the Olohe to grasp.
Bruised and bleeding from repeated falls on the
rough lava, both of the combatants were becoming
very weary. Then the chief made a new attack,
forcing the Olohe into a narrow place from which
there was no escape, and at last seizing him,
breaking his bones, and then killing him.</p>

<p>As the shadows of night rested over the temple
and its sacred grave the chief crept closer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the dreaded tabu walls. Concealing himself
he waited for the ghost to reveal to him the best
plan for action. The ghost came, but was compelled
to bid the father wait patiently for a fit
time when the secret place in which the bones
were hidden could be safely visited.</p>

<p>For several days and nights the chief hid himself
near the temple. He secretly uttered the
prayers and incantations needed to secure the
protection of his family gods.</p>

<p>One night the darkness was very great, and
the priests and watchmen of the temple felt sure
that no one would attempt to enter the sacred
precincts. Deep sleep rested upon all the temple-dwellers.</p>

<p>Then the ghost of Kahele hastened to the place
where the father was sleeping and aroused him
for the dangerous task before him.</p>

<p>As the father arose he saw this ghost outlined
in the darkness, beckoning him to follow. Step
by step he felt his way cautiously over the rough
path and along the temple walls until he saw
the ghost standing near a great rock pointing at
a part of the wall.</p>

<p>The father seized a stone which seemed to
be the one most directly in the line of the ghost's
pointing. To his surprise it very easily was removed
from the wall. Back of it was a hollow
place in which lay a bundle of folded bones.
The ghost urged the chief to take these bones
and depart quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p><p>The father obeyed, and followed the spirit
guide until safely away from the temple of the
burning wrath of the gods. He carried the bones
to Kau and placed them in his own secret family
burial cave.</p>

<p>The ghost of Wahaula went down to the spirit
world in great joy. Death had come. The life
of the young chief had been taken for temple
service and yet there had at last been nothing
dishonorable connected with the destruction of
the body and the passing away of the spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="center">MALUAE AND THE UNDER-WORLD</p>


<p>This is a story from Manoa Valley, back of
Honolulu. In the upper end of the valley,
at the foot of the highest mountains on the
island Oahu, lived Maluae. He was a farmer,
and had chosen this land because rain fell abundantly
on the mountains, and the streams brought
down fine soil from the decaying forests and
disintegrating rocks, fertilizing his plants.</p>

<p>Here he cultivated bananas and taro and sweet
potatoes. His bananas grew rapidly by the sides
of the brooks, and yielded large bunches of fruit
from their tree-like stems; his taro filled small
walled-in pools, growing in the water like water-lilies,
until the roots were matured, when the
plants were pulled up and the roots boiled and
prepared for food; his sweet potatoes&mdash;a vegetable
known among the ancient New Zealanders
as ku-maru, and supposed to have come from
Hawaii&mdash;were planted on the drier uplands.</p>

<p>Thus he had plenty of food continually growing,
and ripening from time to time. Whenever
he gathered any of his food products he brought
a part to his family temple and placed it on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
altar before the gods Kane and Kanaloa, then he
took the rest to his home for his family to eat.</p>

<p>He had a boy whom he dearly loved, whose
name was Kaa-lii (rolling chief). This boy was
a careless, rollicking child.</p>

<p>One day the boy was tired and hungry. He
passed by the temple of the gods and saw bananas,
ripe and sweet, on the little platform before the
gods. He took these bananas and ate them all.</p>

<p>The gods looked down on the altar expecting
to find food, but it was all gone and there was
nothing for them. They were very angry, and
ran out after the boy. They caught him eating
the bananas, and killed him. The body they
left lying under the trees, and taking out his
ghost threw it into the Under-world.</p>

<p>The father toiled hour after hour cultivating
his food plants, and when wearied returned to
his home. On the way he met the two gods.
They told him how his boy had robbed them
of their sacrifices and how they had punished
him. They said, "We have sent his ghost body
to the lowest regions of the Under-world,"</p>

<p>The father was very sorrowful and heavy
hearted as he went on his way to his desolate
home. He searched for the body of his boy, and
at last found it. He saw too that the story of
the gods was true, for partly eaten bananas
filled the mouth, which was set in death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>He wrapped the body very carefully in kapa
cloth made from the bark of trees. He
carried it into his rest-house and laid it on the
sleeping-mat. After a time he lay down beside
the body, refusing all food, and planning to die
with his boy. He thought if he could escape
from his own body he would be able to go down
where the ghost of his boy had been sent. If
he could find that ghost he hoped to take it to
the other part of the Under-world, where they
could be happy together.</p>

<p>He placed no offerings on the altar of the
gods. No prayers were chanted. The afternoon
and evening passed slowly. The gods
waited for their worshipper, but he came not.
They looked down on the altar of sacrifice, but
there was nothing for them.</p>

<p>The night passed and the following day. The
father lay by the side of his son, neither eating
nor drinking, and longing only for death. The
house was tightly closed.</p>

<p>Then the gods talked together, and Kane said:
"Maluae eats no food, he prepares no awa to
drink, and there is no water by him. He is near
the door of the Under-world. If he should die,
we would be to blame."</p>

<p>Kanaloa said: "He has been a good man, but
now we do not hear any prayers. We are losing
our worshipper. We in quick anger killed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
son. Was this the right reward? He has called
us morning and evening in his worship. He has
provided fish and fruits and vegetables for our
altars. He has always prepared awa from the
juice of the yellow awa root for us to drink. We
have not paid him well for his care."</p>

<p>Then they decided to go and give life to the
father, and permit him to take his ghost body
and go down into Po, the dark land, to bring
back the ghost of the boy. So they went to
Maluae and told him they were sorry for what
they had done.</p>

<p>The father was very weak from hunger, and
longing for death, and could scarcely listen to
them.</p>

<p>When Kane said, "Have you love for your
child?" the father whispered: "Yes. My love
is without end." "Can you go down into the
dark land and get that spirit and put it back in
the body which lies here?"</p>

<p>"No," the father said, "no, I can only die
and go to live with him and make him happier
by taking him to a better place."</p>

<p>Then the gods said, "We will give you the
power to go after your boy and we will help you
to escape the dangers of the land of ghosts."</p>

<p>Then the father, stirred by hope, rose up
and took food and drink. Soon he was strong
enough to go on his journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The gods gave him a ghost body and also
prepared a hollow stick like bamboo, in which
they put food, battle-weapons, and a piece of
burning lava for fire.</p>

<p>Not far from Honolulu is a beautiful modern
estate with fine roads, lakes, running brooks,
and interesting valleys extending back into
the mountain range. This is called by the very
ancient name Moanalua (two lakes). Near
the seacoast of this estate was one of the most
noted ghost localities of the islands. The ghosts
after wandering over the island Oahu would
come to this place to find a way into their real
home, the Under-world, or, as the Hawaiians
usually called it, Po.</p>

<p>Here was a ghostly breadfruit-tree named
Lei-walo, possibly meaning "the eight wreaths"
or "the eighth wreath"&mdash;the last wreath of leaves
from the land of the living which would meet
the eyes of the dying.</p>

<p>The ghosts would leap or fly or climb into the
branches of this tree, trying to find a rotten
branch upon which they could sit until it broke
and threw them into the dark sea below.</p>

<p>Maluae climbed up the breadfruit-tree. He
found a branch upon which some ghosts were
sitting waiting for it to fall. His weight was so
much greater than theirs that the branch broke
at once, and down they all fell into the land of
Po.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>He needed merely to taste the food in his hollow
cane to have new life and strength. This he had
done when he climbed the tree; thus he had been
able to push past the fabled guardians of the
pathway of the ghosts in the Upper-world. As
he entered the Under-world he again tasted the
food of the gods and he felt himself growing
stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>He took a magic war-club and a spear out of
the cane given by the gods. Ghostly warriors
tried to hinder his entrance into the different
districts of the dark land. The spirits of dead
chiefs challenged him when he passed their
homes. Battle after battle was fought. His
magic club struck the warriors down, and his
spear tossed them aside.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was warmly greeted and aided
by ghosts of kindly spirit. Thus he went from
place to place, searching for his boy, finding him
at last, as the Hawaiians quaintly expressed it,
"down in the papa-ku" (the established foundation
of Po), choking and suffocating from the
bananas of ghost-land which he was compelled
to continually force into his mouth.</p>

<p>The father caught the spirit of the boy and
started back toward the Upper-world, but the
ghosts surrounded him. They tried to catch
him and take the spirit away from him. Again
the father partook of the food of the gods. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
more he wielded his war-club, but the hosts of
enemies were too great. Multitudes arose on
all sides, crushing him by their overwhelming
numbers.</p>

<p>At last he raised his magic hollow cane and
took the last portion of food. Then he poured
out the portion of burning lava which the gods
had placed inside. It fell upon the dry floor of
the Under-world. The flames dashed into the
trees and the shrubs of ghost-land. Fire-holes
opened in the floor and streams of lava burst
out.</p>

<p>Backward fled the multitudes of spirits. The
father thrust the spirit of the boy quickly into
the empty magic cane and rushed swiftly up to
his home-land. He brought the spirit to the
body lying in the rest-house and forced it to find
again its living home.</p>

<p>Afterward the father and the boy took food
to the altars of the gods, and chanted the accustomed
prayers heartily and loyally all the rest
of their lives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>III</h2>

<p class="center">A GIANT'S ROCK-THROWING</p>


<p>A point of land on the northwestern coast
of the island Oahu is called Ka-lae-o-Kaena
which means "The Cape of Kaena."</p>

<p>Out in the ocean a short distance from this
cape lies a large rock which bears the name
Pohaku-o-Kauai, or rock of Kauai, a large island
northwest of Oahu. This rock is as large as a
small house.</p>

<p>There is an interesting legend told on the island
of Oahu which explains why these names have
for generations been fastened to the cape and to
the rock. A long, long time ago there lived
on the island Kauai a man of wonderful power,
by the name of Hau-pu. When he was born, the
signs of a demi-god were over and around the
house of his birth. Lightning flashed through
the skies, and thunder reverberated, rolling
along the mountain-sides.</p>

<p>Thunder and lightning were very rare in the
Hawaiian Islands, and were supposed to be connected
with the birth or death or some very unusual
occurrence in the life of a chief.</p>

<p>Mighty floods of rain fell and poured in tor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>rents
down the mountain-sides, carrying the red
iron soil into the valleys in such quantities that
the rapids and the waterfalls became the color
of blood, and the natives called this a blood-rain.</p>

<p>During the storm, and even after sunshine
filled the valley, a beautiful rainbow rested over
the house in which the young chief was born.
This rainbow was thought to come from the
miraculous powers of the new-born child shining
out from him instead of from the sunlight around
him. Many chiefs throughout the centuries of
Hawaiian legends were said to have had this
rainbow around them all their lives.</p>

<p>Hau-pu while a child was very powerful, and
after he grew up was widely known as a great
warrior. He would attack and defeat armies of
his enemies without aid from any person. His
spear was like a mighty weapon, sometimes
piercing a host of enemies, and sometimes putting
aside all opposition when he thrust it into the
ranks of his opponents.</p>

<p>If he had thrown his spear and if fighting with
his bare hands did not vanquish his foes, he
would leap to the hillside, tear up a great tree,
and with it sweep away all before him as if he
were wielding a huge broom. He was known
and feared throughout all the Hawaiian Islands.
He became angry quickly and used his great
powers very rashly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>One night he lay sleeping in his royal rest-house
on the side of a mountain which faced the
neighboring island of Oahu. Between the two
islands lay a broad channel about thirty miles
wide. When clouds were on the face of the sea,
these islands were hidden from each other; but
when they lifted, the rugged valleys of the
mountains on one island could be clearly seen
from the other. Even by moonlight the shadowy
lines would appear.</p>

<p>This night the strong man stirred in his sleep.
Indistinct noises seemed to surround his house.
He turned over and dropped off into slumber
again.</p>

<p>Soon he was aroused a second time, and he
was awake enough to hear shouts of men far,
far away. Louder rose the noise mixed with
the roar of the great surf waves, so he realized
that it came from the sea, and he then forced
himself to rise and stumble to the door.</p>

<p>He looked out toward Oahu. A multitude of
lights were flashing on the sea before his sleepy
eyes. A low murmur of many voices came from
the place where the dancing lights seemed to be.
His confused thoughts made it appear to him
that a great fleet of warriors was coming from
Oahu to attack his people.</p>

<p>He blindly rushed out to the edge of a high
precipice which overlooked the channel. Evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>dently
many boats and many people were out
in the sea below.</p>

<p>He laughed, and stooped down and tore a huge
rock from its place. This he swung back and
forth, back and forth, back and forth, until he
gave it great impetus which added to his own
miraculous power sent it far out over the sea.
Like a great cloud it rose in the heavens and, as
if blown by swift winds, sped on its way.</p>

<p>Over on the shores of Oahu a chief whose
name was Kaena had called his people out for
a night's fishing. Canoes large and small came
from all along the coast. Torches without number
had been made and placed in the canoes.
The largest fish-nets had been brought.</p>

<p>There was no need of silence. Nets had been
set in the best places. Fish of all kinds were to
be aroused and frightened into the nets. Flashing
lights, splashing paddles, and clamor from
hundreds of voices resounded all around the nets.</p>

<p>Gradually the canoes came nearer and nearer
the centre. The shouting increased. Great joy
ruled the noise which drowned the roar of the
waves.</p>

<p>Across the channel and up the mountain-sides
of Kauai swept the shouts of the fishing-party.
Into the ears of drowsy Hau-pu the noise forced
itself. Little dreamed the excited fishermen of
the effect of this on far-away Kauai.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly something like a bird as large as a
mountain seemed to be above, and then with a
mighty sound like the roar of winds it descended
upon them.</p>

<p>Smashed and submerged were the canoes when
the huge boulder thrown by Hau-pu hurled itself
upon them.</p>

<p>The chief Kaena and his canoe were in the
centre of this terrible mass of wreckage, and he
and many of his people lost their lives.</p>

<p>The waves swept sand upon the shore until in
time a long point of land was formed. The
remaining followers of the dead chief named this
cape "Kaena."</p>

<p>The rock thrown by Hau-pu embedded itself
deeply in the bed of the ocean, but its head rose
far above the water, even when raging storms
dashed turbulent waves against it. To this
death-dealing rock the natives gave the name
"Rock of Kauai."</p>

<p>Thus for generations has the deed of the man
of giant force been remembered on Oahu, and so
have a cape and a rock received their names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">KALO-EKE-EKE, THE TIMID TARO</p>


<p>A myth is a purely imaginative story. A
legend is a story with some foundation in
fact. A fable tacks on a moral. A tradition is
a myth or legend or fact handed down from
generation to generation.</p>

<p>The old Hawaiians were frequently myth
makers. They imagined many a fairy-story for
the different localities of the islands, and these
are very interesting. The myth of the two taro
plants belongs to South Kona, Hawaii, and
affords an excellent illustration of Hawaiian
imagination. The story is told in different ways,
and came to the writer in the present form:</p>

<p>A chief lived on the mountain-side above
Hookena. There his people cultivated taro,
made kapa cloth, and prepared the trunks of
koa-trees for canoes. He had a very fine taro
patch. The plants prided themselves upon their
rapid and perfect growth.</p>

<p>In one part of the taro pond, side by side,
grew two taro plants&mdash;finer, stronger, and more
beautiful than the others. The leaf stalks bent
over in more perfect curves: the leaves developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in graceful proportions. Mutual admiration
filled the hearts of the two taro plants and resulted
in pledges of undying affection.</p>

<p>One day the chief was talking to his servants
about the food to be made ready for a feast. He
ordered the two especially fine taro plants to be
pulled up. One of the servants came to the
home of the two lovers and told them that they
were to be taken by the chief.</p>

<p>Because of their great affection for each other
they determined to cling to life as long as possible,
and therefore moved to another part of the taro
patch, leaving their neighbors to be pulled up
instead of themselves.</p>

<p>But the chief soon saw them in their new home
and again ordered their destruction. Again they
fled. This happened from time to time until
the angry chief determined that they should be
taken, no matter what part of the pond they
might be in.</p>

<p>The two taro plants thought best to flee,
therefore took to themselves wings and made a
short flight to a neighboring taro patch. Here
again their enemy found them. A second flight
was made to another part of South Kona, and
then to still another, until all Kona was interested
in the perpetual pursuit and the perpetual
escape. At last there was no part of Kona in
which they could be concealed. A friend of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
angry chief would reveal their hiding-place, while
one of their own friends would give warning of
the coming of their pursuer. At last they leaped
into the air and flew on and on until they were
utterly weary and fell into a taro patch near
Waiohinu. But their chief had ordered the imu
(cooking-place) to be made ready for them, and
had hastened along the way on foot, trying to
capture them if at any time they should try to
light. However, their wings moved more swiftly
than his feet, so they had a little rest before he
came near to their new home. Then again they
lifted themselves into the sky. Favoring winds
carried them along and they flew a great distance
away from South Kona into the neighboring
district of Kau. Here they found a new home
under a kindly chief. Here they settled down
and lived many years under the name of Kalo-eke-eke, or
"The Timid Taro." A large family
grew up about them and a happy old age blessed
their declining days.</p>

<p>It is possible that this beautiful little story
may have grown out of the ancient Hawaiian
unwritten law which sometimes permitted the
subjects of a chief to move away from their home
and transfer their allegiance to some neighboring
ruler.</p>

<p class="center">LEGENDARY CANOE-MAKING</p>


<p>Some of the Hawaiian trees have beautifully
grained wood, and at the present time are
very valuable for furniture and interior decoration.
The koa is probably the best of the trees
of this class. It is known as the Hawaiian
mahogany. The grain is very fine and curly
and wavy, and is capable of a very high polish.
The koa still grows luxuriantly on the steep sides
and along the ridges of the high mountains of
all the islands of the Hawaiian group. It has
great powers of endurance. It is not easily worn
by the pebbles and sand of the beach, nor is it
readily split or broken by the tempestuous
waves of the ocean, therefore from time immemorial
the koa has been the tree for the canoe and
surf-board of the Hawaiians. Long and large
have been the canoes hewn from the massive
tree trunks by the aid of the kohi-pohaku, the
cutting stone, or adze, of ancient Hawaii. Some
times these canoes were given miraculous powers
of motion so that they swept through the seas
more rapidly than the swiftest shark. Often
the god of the winds, who had especial care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
over some one of the high chiefs, would carry him
from island to island in a canoe which never
rested when calms prevailed or stopped when
fierce waves wrenched, but bore the chief swiftly
and unfailingly to the desired haven.</p>

<p>There is a delightful little story about a chief
who visited the most northerly island, Kauai.
He found the natives of that island feasting and
revelling in all the abandon of savage life. Sports
and games innumerable were enjoyed. Thus
day and night passed until, as the morning of a
new day dawned, an unwonted stir along the
beach made manifest some event of very great
importance. The new chief apparently cared
but little for all the excitement. The king of
the island had sent one of his royal ornaments
to a small island some miles distant from the
Kauai shores. He was blessed with a daughter
so beautiful that all the available chiefs desired
her for wife. The father, hoping to avoid the
complications which threatened to involve his
household with the households of the jealous
suitors, announced that he would give his
daughter to the man who secured the ornament
from the far-away island. It was to be a canoe
race with a wife for the prize.</p>

<p>The young chiefs waited for the hour appointed.
Their well-polished koa canoes lined the beach.
The stranger chief made no preparation. Quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
he enjoyed the gibes and taunts hurled from one
to another by the young chiefs. Laughingly
he requested permission to join in the contest,
receiving as the reward for his request a look
of approbation from the handsome chiefess.</p>

<p>The word was given. The well-manned canoes
were pushed from the shore and forced out through
the inrolling surf. In the rush some of the boats
were interlocked with others, some filled with
water, while others safely broke away from the
rest and passed out of sight toward the coveted
island. Still the stranger seemed to be in no
haste to win the prize. The face of the chiefess
grew dark with disappointment.</p>

<p>At last the stranger launched his finely polished
canoe and called one of his followers to sail with
him. It seemed to be utterly impossible for him
to even dream of securing the prize, but the
canoe began to move as if it had the wings of a
swift bird or the fins of fleetest fish. He had
taken for his companion in his magic canoe one
of the gods controlling the ocean winds. He was
first to reach the island. Then he came swiftly
back for his bride. He made his home among
his new friends.</p>

<p>The Hawaiians had many interesting ceremonies
in connection with the process of securing
the tree and fashioning it into a canoe.</p>

<p>David Malo, a Hawaiian writer of about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
year 1840, says, "The building of a canoe was a
religious matter." When a man found a fine koa
tree he went to the priest whose province was
canoe-making and said, "I have found a koa-tree,
a fine large tree." On receiving this information
the priest went at night to sleep before his shrine.
If in his sleep he had a vision of some one
standing naked before him, he knew that the
koa-tree was rotten, and would not go up into
the woods to cut that tree. If another tree was
found and he dreamed of a handsome well-dressed
man or woman standing before him, when he
awoke he felt sure that the tree would make a
good canoe. Preparations were made accordingly
to go into the mountains and hew the koa into
a canoe. They took with them as offerings a
pig, cocoanuts, red fish, and awa. Having come
to the place they rested for the night, sacrificing
these things to the gods.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when a royal canoe was to be
prepared, it seems as if human beings were also
brought and slain at the root of the tree. There is
no record of cannibalism connected with these
sacrifices, and yet when the pig and fish had
been offered before the tree, usually a hole was
dug close to the tree and an oven prepared in
which the meat and vegetables were cooked for
the morning feast of the canoe-makers. The tree
was carefully examined and the signs and por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>tents
noted. The song of a little bird would
frequently cause an entire change in the enterprise.</p>

<p>When the time came to cut down the tree
the priest would take his stone axe and offer
prayer to the male and female deities who were
supposed to be the special patrons of canoe
building, showing them the axe, and saying:
"Listen now to the axe. This is the axe which
is to cut down the tree for the canoe."</p>

<p>David Malo says: "When the tree began to
crack, ready to fall, they lowered their voices
and allowed no one to make a disturbance.
When the tree had fallen, the head priest mounted
the trunk and called out, 'Smite with the axe,
and hollow the canoe.' This was repeated again
and again as he walked along the fallen tree,
marking the full length of the desired canoe."</p>

<p>Dr. Emerson gives the following as one of the
prayers sometimes used by the priest when passing a
long the trunk of the tree:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grant a canoe which shall be swift as a fish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To sail in stormy seas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the storm tosses on all sides."<br />
</p>

<p>After the canoe had been roughly shaped, the
ends pointed, the bottom rounded, and perhaps
a portion of the inside of the log removed, the
people fastened lines to the canoe to haul it down
to the beach. When they were ready for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
work the priest again prayed: "Oh, canoe gods,
look you after this canoe. Guard it from stem to
stern, until it is placed in the canoe-house."</p>

<p>Then the canoe was hauled by the people
in front, or held back by those who were in the
rear, until it had passed all the hard and steep
places along the mountain-side and been put in
place for the finishing touches. When completed,
pig and fish and fruits were again offered to the
gods. Sometimes human beings were again a
part of the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Prayers and incantations were part of the
ceremony. There was to be no disturbance or
noise, or else it would be dangerous for its owner
to go out in his new canoe. If all the people
except the priest had been quiet, the canoe was
pronounced safe.</p>

<p>It is said that the ceremony of lashing the
outrigger to the canoe was of very great solemnity,
probably because the ability to pass through the
high surf waves depended so much upon the out
rigger as a balance which kept the canoe from
being overturned.</p>

<p>The story of Laka and the fairies is told to
illustrate the difficulties surrounding canoe
making. Laka desired to make a fine canoe, and
sought through the forests for the best tree
available. Taking his stone axe he toiled all day
until the tree was felled. Then he went home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to rest. On the morrow he could not find the
log. The trees of the forest had been apparently
undisturbed. Again he cut a tree, and once
more could not find the log. At last he cut a
tree and watched in the night. Then he saw
in the night shadows a host of the little people
who toil with miraculous powers to support them.
They raised the tree and set it in its place and
restored it to its wonted appearance among
its fellows. But Laka caught the king of the
gnomes and from him learned how to gain the
aid rather than the opposition of the little people.
By their help his canoe was taken to the shore
and fashioned into beautiful shape for wonderful
and successful voyages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LAU-KA-IEIE</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waipio valley, the beautiful:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precipices around it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea on one side;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precipices are hard to climb;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be climbed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the sea precipices."<br />
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<i>Hawaiian Chant.</i><br />
</p>


<p>Kakea (the white one) and Kaholo (the
runner) were the children of the Valley.
Their parents were the precipices which were
sheer to the sea, and could only be passed by
boats. They married, and Kaholo conceived.
The husband said, "If a boy is born, I will name
it; if a girl, you give the name."</p>

<p>He went up to see his sister Pokahi, and asked
her to go swiftly to see his wife. Pokahi's husband
was Kaukini, a bird-catcher. He went out
into the forest for some birds. Soon he came
back and prepared them for cooking. Hot stones
were put inside the birds and the birds were
packed in calabashes, carefully covered over
with wet leaves, which made steam inside so
the birds were well cooked. Then they were
brought to Kaholo for a feast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>On their way they went down to Waipio Valley,
coming to the foot of the precipice. Pokahi
wanted some sea-moss and some shell-fish, so
she told the two men to go on while she secured
these things to take to Kaholo. She gathered
the soft lipoa moss and went up to the waterfall,
to Ulu (Kaholo's home). The baby was
born, wrapped in the moss and thrown into
the sea, making a shapeless bundle, but a kupua
(sorcerer) saw that a child was there. The child
was taken and washed clean in the soft lipoa, and
cared for. All around were the signs of the birth
of a chief.</p>

<p>They named him Hiilawe, and from him the
Waipio waterfall has its name, according to the
saying, "Falling into mist is the water of Hiilawe."</p>

<p>Pokahi took up her package in which she had
brought the moss and shell-fish, but the moss
was gone. Hina-ulu-ohia (Hina-the-growing
ohia-tree) was the sorcerer who took the child
in the lipoa moss. She was the aumakua, or
ancestor goddess, of the boat-builders.</p>

<p>Pokahi dreamed that a beautiful woman appeared,
her body covered with the leaves of
koa-trees. "I know that you have not had any
child. I will now give you one. Awake, and
go to the Waipio River; watch thirty days, then
you will find a girl wrapped in soft moss. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
shall be your adopted child. I will show you how
to care for it. Your brother and his wife must
not know. Your husband alone may know about
this adopted girl."</p>

<p>Pokahi and her husband went down at once to
the mouth of the river, heard an infant cry in
the midst of red-colored mist, and found a child
wrapped in the fragrant moss. She wished to
take it up, but was held back by magic powers.
She saw an ohia-tree rising up from the water,&mdash;branches,
leaves, and flowers,&mdash;and iiwi (birds)
coming to pick the flowers. The red birds and
red flowers were very beautiful. This tree was
Hina. The birds began to sing, and quietly the
tree sank down into the water and disappeared,
the birds flying away to the west.</p>

<p>Pokahi returned to her brother's house, going
down to the sea every day, where she saw the
human form of the child growing in the shelter
of that red mist on the surface of the sea. At
the end of the thirty days Pokahi told her friends
and her husband that they must go back home.
On their way they went to the river. She told
her husband to look at the red mist, but he
wanted to hurry on. As they approached their
house, cooking-odors welcomed them, and they
found plenty of food prepared outside. They
saw something moving inside. The trees seemed
to be walking as if with the feet of men. Steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
were heard, and voices were calling for the people
of the house.</p>

<p>Kaukini prepared a lamp, and Pokahi in a
vision saw the same fine tree which she had seen
before. There was also a hala-tree with its
beautiful yellow blossoms. As they looked they
saw leaves of different kinds falling one after
another, making in one place a soft fragrant
bed.</p>

<p>Then a woman and a man came with an infant.
They were the god Ku and Hina his wife. They
said to Pokahi and her husband, "We have
accepted your sacrifices and have seen that you
are childless, so now we have brought you this
child to adopt." Then they disappeared among
the trees of the forest, leaving the child, Lau-ka-ieie
(leaf of the ieie vine). She was well cared
for and grew up into a beautiful woman without
fault or blemish. Her companions and servants
were the birds and the flowers.</p>

<p>Lau-ka-pali (leaf of the precipice) was one
of her friends. One day she made whistles of
ti leaves, and blew them. The Leaf-of-the
Morning-Glory saw that the young chiefess liked
this, so she went out and found Pupu-kani-oi
(the singing land-shell), whose home was on the
leaves of the forest trees. Then she found another
Pupu-hina-hina-ula (shell beautiful, with rainbow
colors). In the night the shells sang, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
voices stole their way into the love of Lau-ka-ieie,
so she gently sang with them.</p>

<p>Nohu-ua-palai (a fern), one of the old residents
of that place, went out into the forest, and,
hearing the voices of the girl and the shells, came
to the house. She chanted her name, but there
was no reply. All was silent. At last, Pua-ohelo
(the blossom of the ohelo), one of the flowers
in the house, heard, and opening the door, invited
her to come in and eat.</p>

<p>Nohu-ua-palai went in and feasted with the
girls. Lau-ka-ieie dreamed about Kawelona
(the setting of the sun), at Lihue, a fine young
man, the first-born of one of the high chiefs of
Kauai. She told her kahu (guardian) all about
her dream and the distant island. The kahu
asked who should go to find the man of the
dreams. All the girl friends wanted to go.
She told them to raise their hands and the one
who had the longest fingers could go. This was
Pupu-kani-oi (the singing shell). The leaf family
all sobbed as they bade farewell to the shell.</p>

<p>The shell said: "Oh, my leaf-sisters Laukoa
[leaf of the koa-tree] and Lauanau [leaf of the
tapa, or paper-mulberry, tree], arise, go with me
on my journey! Oh, my shell-sisters of the
blue sea, come to the beach, to the sand! Come
and show me the path I am to go! Oh, Pupu-moka-lau
[the land-shell clinging to the moka<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>hana
leaf], come and look at me, for I am one
of your family! Call all the shells to aid me
in my journey! Come to me!"</p>

<p>Then she summoned her brother, Makani-kau,
chief of the winds, to waft them away in their
wind bodies. They journeyed all around the
island of Hawaii to find some man who would
be like the man of the dream. They found no
one there nor on any of the other islands up to
Oahu, where the Singing Shell fell in love with
a chief and turned from her journey, but Makani-kau
went on to Kauai.</p>

<p>Ma-eli-eli, the dragon woman of Heeia, tried
to persuade him to stop, but on he went. She
ran after him. Limaloa, the dragon of Laiewai,
also tried to catch Makani-kau, but he was too
swift. On the way to Kauai, Makani-kau saw
some people in a boat chased by a big shark. He
leaped on the boat and told them he would play
with the shark and they could stay near but
need not fear. Then he jumped into the sea.
The shark turned over and opened its mouth
to seize him; he climbed on it, caught its fins,
and forced it to flee through the water. He
drove it to the shore and made it fast among
the rocks. It became a great shark stone,
Koa-mano (warrior shark), at Haena. He leaped
from the shark to land, the boat following.</p>

<p>He saw the hill of "Fire-Throwing," a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
where burning sticks were thrown over the
precipices, a very beautiful sight at night. He
leaped to the top of the hill in his shadow body.
Far up on the hill was a vast number of iiwi
(birds). Makani-kau went to them as they were
flying toward Lehua. They only felt the force
of the winds, for they could not see him or his
real body. He saw that the birds were carrying
a fine man as he drew near.</p>

<p>This was the one Lau-ka-ieie desired for her
husband. They carried this boy on their wings
easily and gently over the hills and sea toward
the sunset island, Lehua. There they slowly
flew to earth. They were the bird guardians of
Kawelona, and when they travelled from place
to place they were under the direction of the
bird-sorcerer, Kukala-a-ka-manu.</p>

<p>Kawelona had dreamed of a beautiful girl
who had visited him again and again, so he was
prepared to meet Makani-kau. He told his
parents and adopted guardians and bird-priests
about his dreams and the beautiful girl he wanted
to marry.</p>

<p>Makani-kau met the winds of Niihau and
Lehua, and at last was welcomed by the birds.
He told Kawelona his mission, who prepared to
go to Hawaii, asking how they should go. Makani-kau
went to the seaside and called for his
many bodies to come and give him the boat for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the husband of their great sister Lau-ka-ieie.
Thus he made known his mana, or spirit power,
to Kawelona. He called on the great cloud-gods
to send the long white cloud-boat, and it soon
appeared. Kawelona entered the boat with fear,
and in a few minutes lost sight of the island of
Lehua and his bird guardians as he sailed out
into the sea. Makani-kau dropped down by
the side of a beautiful shell-boat, entered it, and
stopped at Mana. There he took several girls
and put them in a double canoe, or au-waa-olalua
(spirit-boat).</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sorcerer ruler of the birds
agreed to find out where Kawelona was to
satisfy the longing of his parents, whom he had
left without showing them where he was going
or what dangers he might meet. The sorcerer
poured water into a calabash and threw in two
lehua flowers, which floated on the water. Then
he turned his eyes toward the sun and prayed:
"Oh, great sun, to whom belongs the heavens,
turn your eyes downward to look on the water
in this calabash, and show us what you see
therein! Look upon the beautiful young woman.
She is not one from Kauai. There is no one
more beautiful than she. Her home is under
the glowing East, and a royal rainbow is around
her. There are beautiful girls attending her."
The sorcerer saw the sun-pictures in the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and interpreted to the friends the journey of Kawelona,
telling them it was a long, long way, and
they must wait patiently many days for any
word. In the signs he saw the boy in the
cloud-boat, Makani-kau in his shell-boat, and
the three girls in the spirit-boat.</p>

<p>The girls were carried to Oahu, and there
found the shell-girl, Pupu-kani-oi, left by Makani-kau
on his way to Lehua. They took her
with her husband and his sisters in the spirit-boat.
There were nine in the company of
travellers to Hawaii: Kawelona in his cloud-boat;
two girls from Kauai; Kaiahe, a girl from
Oahu; three from Molokai, one from Maui; and
a girl called Lihau. Makani-kau himself was
the leader; he had taken the girls away. On
this journey he turned their boats to Kahoolawe
to visit Ka-moho-alii, the ruler of the sharks.
There Makani-kau appeared in his finest human
body, and they all landed. Makani-kau took
Kawelona from his cloud-boat, went inland,
and placed him in the midst of the company,
telling them he was the husband for Lau-ka-ieie.
They were all made welcome by the ruler of the
sharks.</p>

<p>Ka-moho-alii called his sharks to bring food
from all the islands over which they were placed
as guardians; so they quickly brought prepared
food, fish, flowers, leis, and gifts of all kinds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
The company feasted and rested. Then Ka-moho-alii
called his sharks to guard the travellers
on their journey. Makani-kau went in his shell
boat, Kawelona in his cloud-boat, and they
were all carried over the sea until they landed
under the mountains of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Makani-kau, in his wind body, carried the boats
swiftly on their journey to Waipio. Lau-ka-ieie
heard her brother's voice calling her from the
sea. Hina answered. Makani-kau and Kawelona
went up to Waimea to cross over to Lau-ka-ieie's
house, but were taken by Hina to the
top of Mauna Kea. Poliahu and Lilinoe saw
the two fine young men and called to them, but
Makani-kau passed by, without a word, to his
own wonderful home in the caves of the mountains
resting in the heart of mists and fogs, and
placed all his travellers there. Makani-kau went
down to the sea and called the sharks of Ka-moho-alii.
They appeared in their human bodies
in the valley of Waipio, leaving their shark bodies
resting quietly in the sea. They feasted and
danced near the ancient temple of Kahuku-welo-welo,
which was the place where the wonderful
shell, Kiha-pu, was kept.</p>

<p>Makani-kau put seven shells on the top of the
precipice and they blew until sweet sounds floated
over all the land. Thus was the marriage of
Lau-ka-ieie and Kawelona celebrated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>All the shark people rested, soothed by the
music. After the wedding they bade farewell
and returned to Kahoolawe, going around the
southern side of the island, for it was counted
bad luck to turn back. They must go straight
ahead all the way home. Makani-kau went to
his sister's house, and met the girls and Lau-ka-ieie.
He told her that his house was full of
strangers, as the people of the different kupua
bodies had assembled to celebrate the wedding.
These were the kupua people of the Hawaiian
Islands. The eepa people were more like fairies
and gnomes, and were usually somewhat deformed.
The kupuas may be classified as follows:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;Ka-poe-kino-lau (the people who had leaf bodies).<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"&nbsp;   &nbsp; -pua (the people who had flower bodies).</span><br />

</p>

<p>After the marriage, Pupu-kani-oi (the singing
shell) and her husband entered the shell-boat,
and started back to Molokai. On their way they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
heard sweet bird voices. Makani-kau had a
feather house covered with rainbow colors.
Later he went to Kauai, and brought back the
adopted parents of Kawelona to dwell on Hawaii,
where Lau-ka-ieie lived happily with her husband.</p>

<p>Hiilawe became very ill, and called his brother
Makani-kau and his sister Lau-ka-ieie to come
near and listen. He told them that he was
going to die, and they must bury him where he
could always see the eyes of the people, and then
he would change his body into a wonderful new
body.</p>

<p>The beautiful girl took his malo and leis and
placed them along the sides of the valley, where
they became beautiful trees and vines, and Hina
made him live again; so Hiilawe became an
aumakua of the waterfalls. Makani-kau took
the body in his hands and carried it in the thunder
and lightning, burying it on the brow of the highest
precipice of the valley. Then his body was
changed into a stone, which has been lying there
for centuries; but his ghost was made by Hina
into a kupua, so that he could always appear as
the wonderful misty falls of Waipio, looking into
the eyes of his people.</p>

<p>After many years had passed Hina assumed
permanently the shape of the beautiful ohia-tree,
making her home in the forest around the volcanoes
of Hawaii. She still had magic power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and was worshipped under the name Hina-ula-ohia.
Makani-kau watched over Lau-ka-ieie,
and when the time came for her to lay aside
her human body she came to him as a slender,
graceful woman, covered with leaves, her eyes
blazing like fire. Makani-kau said: "You are
a vine; you cannot stand alone. I will carry you
into the forest and place you by the side of Hina.
You are the ieie vine. Climb trees! Twine
your long leaves around them! Let your blazing
red flowers shine between the leaves like eyes of
fire! Give your beauty to all the ohia-trees of
the forest!"</p>

<p>Carried hither and thither by Makani-kau
(great wind), and dropped by the side of splendid
tall trees, the ieie vine has for centuries been
one of the most graceful tree ornaments in all
the forest life of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

<p>Makani-kau in his spirit form blew the golden
clouds of the islands into the light of the sun,
so that the Rainbow Maiden, Anuenue, might
lend her garments to all her friends of the
ancient days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class="center">KAUHUHU, THE SHARK-GOD OF
MOLOKAI</p>


<p>The story of the shark-god Kauhuhu has
been told under the legend of "Aikanaka
(Man-eater)," which was the ancient name of the
little harbor Pukoo, which lies at the entrance
to one of the beautiful valleys of the island of
Molokai. The better way is to take the legend
as revealing the great man-eater in one of his
most kindly aspects. The shark-god appears as
the friend of a priest who is seeking revenge for
the destruction of his children. Kamalo was the
name of the priest. His heiau, or temple, was at
Kaluaaha, a village which faced the channel
between the islands of Molokai and Maui. Across
the channel the rugged red-brown slopes of the
mountain Eeke were lost in the masses of clouds
which continually hung around its sharp peaks.
The two boys of the priest delighted in the glorious
revelations of sunrise and sunset tossed in
shattered fragments of cloud color, and revelled
in the reflected tints which danced to them over
the swift channel-currents. It is no wonder that
the courage of sky and sea entered into the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the boys, and that many deeds of daring were
done by them. They were taught many of the
secrets of the temple by their father, but were
warned that certain things were sacred to the
gods and must not be touched. The high chief,
or alii, of that part of the island had a temple a
short distance from Kaluaaha, in the valley of
the harbor which was called Aikanaka. The
name of this chief was Kupa. The chiefs always
had a house built within the temple walls as
their own residence, to which they could retire
at certain seasons of the year. Kupa had two
remarkable drums which he kept in his house at
the heiau. His skill in beating his drums was so
great that they could reveal his thoughts to the
waiting priests.</p>

<p>One day Kupa sailed far away over the sea
to his favorite fishing-grounds. Meanwhile the
boys were tempted to go to Kupa's heiau and try
the wonderful drums. The valley of the little
harbor Aikanaka bore the musical name Mapulehu.
Along the beach and over the ridge hastened
the two sons of Kamalo. Quickly they
entered the heiau, found the high chief's house,
took out his drums and began to beat upon them.
Some of the people heard the familiar tones of
the drums. They dared not enter the sacred
doors of the heiau, but watched until the boys
became weary of their sport and returned home.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/066.jpg" width="360" height="600" alt="KUKUI-TREES, IAO VALLEY, MT. EEKE" title="" />
<span class="caption">KUKUI-TREES, IAO VALLEY, MT. EEKE</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p><p>When Kupa returned they told him how the boys
had beaten upon his sacred drums. Kupa was
very angry, and ordered his mu, or temple sacrifice
seekers, to kill the boys and bring their bodies
to the heiau to be placed on the altar. When the
priest Kamalo heard of the death of his sons,
in bitterness of heart he sought revenge. His
own power was not great enough to cope with
his high chief; therefore he sought the aid of
the seers and prophets of highest repute throughout
Molokai. But they feared Kupa the chief,
and could not aid him, and therefore sent him on
to another kaula, or prophet, or sent him back to
consult some one the other side of his home. All
this time he carried with him fitting presents and
sacrifices, by which he hoped to gain the assistance
of the gods through their priests. At last
he came to the steep precipice which overlooks
Kalaupapa and Kalawao, the present home of the
lepers. At the foot of this precipice was a heiau,
in which the great shark-god was worshipped.
Down the sides of the precipice he climbed and
at last found the priest of the shark-god. The
priest refused to give assistance, but directed him
to go to a great cave in the bold cliffs south of
Kalawao. The name of the cave was Anao-puhi,
the cave of the eel. Here dwelt the great
shark-god Kauhuhu and his guardians or watchers,
Waka and Mo-o, the great dragons or reptiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of Polynesian legends. These dragons were
mighty warriors in the defence of the shark-god,
and were his kahus, or caretakers, while he slept,
or when his cave needed watching during his
absence.</p>

<p>Kamalo, tired and discouraged, plodded along
through the rough lava fragments piled around
the entrance to the cave. He bore across his
shoulders a black pig, which he had carried many
miles as an offering to whatever power he could
find to aid him. As he came near to the cave
the watchmen saw him and said:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"E, here comes a man, food for the great
[shark] Mano. Fish for Kauhuhu." But Kamalo
came nearer and for some reason aroused
sympathy in the dragons. "E hele! E hele!"
they cried to him. "Away, away! It is death
to you. Here's the tabu place." "Death it
may be&mdash;life it may be. Give me revenge for
my sons&mdash;and I have no care for myself." Then
the watchmen asked about his trouble and he
told them how the chief Kupa had slain his sons
as a punishment for beating the drums. Then
he narrated the story of his wanderings all over
Molokai, seeking for some power strong enough
to overcome Kupa. At last he had come to the
shark-god&mdash;as the final possibility of aid. If
Kauhuhu failed him, he was ready to die; indeed
he had no wish to live. The mo-o assured him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
their kindly feelings, and told him that it was a
very good thing that Kauhuhu was away fishing,
for if he had been home there would have been
no way for him to go before the god without
suffering immediate death. There would have
been not even an instant for explanations. Yet
they ran a very great risk in aiding him, for they
must conceal him until the way was opened by
the favors of the great gods. If he should be
discovered and eaten before gaining the aid of
the shark-god, they, too, must die with him.
They decided that they would hide him in the
rubbish pile of taro peelings which had been
thrown on one side when they had pounded taro.
Here he must lie in perfect silence until the way
was made plain for him to act. They told him
to watch for the coming of eight great surf waves
rolling in from the sea, and then wait from his
place of concealment for some opportunity to
speak to the god because he would come in the
last great wave. Soon the surf began to roll in
and break against the cliffs.</p>

<p>Higher and higher rose the waves until the
eighth reared far above the waters and met
the winds from the shore which whipped the
curling crest into a shower of spray. It raced
along the water and beat far up into the cave,
breaking into foam, out of which the shark-god
emerged. At once he took his human form and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
walked around the cave. As he passed the rubbish
heap he cried out: "A man is here. I smell
him." The dragons earnestly denied that any
one was there, but the shark-god said, "There is
surely a man in this cave. If I find him, dead men
you are. If I find him not, you shall live."
Then Kauhuhu looked along the walls of the cave
and into all the hiding-places, but could not find
him. He called with a loud voice, but only the
echoes answered, like the voices of ghosts. After
a thorough search he was turning away to attend
to other matters when Kamalo's pig squealed.
Then the giant shark-god leaped to the pile of
taro leavings and thrust them apart. There lay
Kamalo and the black pig which had been brought
for sacrifice.</p>

<p>Oh, the anger of the god!</p>

<p>Oh, the blazing eyes!</p>

<p>Kauhuhu instantly caught Kamalo and lifted
him from the rubbish up toward his great mouth.
Now the head and shoulders are in Kauhuhu's
mouth. So quickly has this been done that
Kamalo has had no time to think. Kamalo
speaks quickly as the teeth are coming down
upon him. "E Kauhuhu, listen to me. Hear
my prayer. Then perhaps eat me." The shark-god
is astonished and does not bite. He takes
Kamalo from his mouth and says: "Well for you
that you spoke quickly. Perhaps you have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
good thought. Speak." Then Kamalo told
about his sons and their death at the hands of
the executioners of the great chief, and that no
one dared avenge him, but that all the prophets
of the different gods had sent him from one place
to another but could give him no aid. Sure now
was he that Kauhuhu alone could give him aid.
Pity came to the shark-god as it had come to his
dragon watchers when they saw the sad condition
of Kamalo. All this time Kamalo had held
the hog which he had carried with him for sacrifice.
This he now offered to the shark-god. Kauhuhu,
pleased and compassionate, accepted the offering,
and said: "E Kamalo. If you had come for any
other purpose I would eat you, but your cause is
sacred. I will stand as your kahu, your guardian,
and sorely punish the high chief Kupa."</p>

<p>Then he told Kamalo to go to the heiau of the
priest who told him to see the shark-god, take this
priest on his shoulders, carry him over the steep
precipices to his own heiau at Kaluaaha, and
there live with him as a fellow-priest. They were
to build a tabu fence around the heiau and put
up the sacred tabu staffs of white tapa cloth.
They must collect black pigs by the four hundred,
red fish by the four hundred, and white chickens
by the four hundred. Then they were to wait
patiently for the coming of Kauhuhu. It was to
be a strange coming. On the island Lanai, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to the west of the Maui channel, they should see
a small cloud, white as snow, increasing until it
covers the little island. Then that cloud shall
cross the channel against the wind and climb the
mountains of Molokai until it rests on the highest
peaks over the valley where Kupa has his temple.
"At that time," said Kauhuhu, "a great rainbow
will span the valley. I shall be in the care of
that rainbow, and you may clearly understand
that I am there and will speedily punish the man
who has injured you. Remember that because
you came to me for this sacred cause, therefore I
have spared you, the only man who has ever
stood in the presence of the shark-god and escaped
alive." Gladly did Kamalo go up and
down precipices and along the rough hard ways
to the heiau of the priest of the shark-god. Gladly
did he carry him up from Kalaupapa to the mountain-ridge
above. Gladly did he carry him to his
home and there provide for him while he gathered
together the black pigs, the red fish, and the white
chickens within the sacred enclosure he had built.
Here he brought his family, those who had the
nearest and strongest claims upon him. When
his work was done, his eyes burned with watching
the clouds of the little western island Lanai.
Ah, the days passed by so slowly! The weeks
and the months came, so the legends say, and
still Kamalo waited in patience. At last one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a white cloud appeared. It was unlike all the
other white clouds he had anxiously watched during
the dreary months. Over the channel it came.
It spread over the hillsides and climbed the
mountains and rested at the head of the valley
belonging to Kupa. Then the watchers saw the
glorious rainbow and knew that Kauhuhu had
come according to his word.</p>

<p>The storm arose at the head of the valley. The
winds struggled into a furious gale. The clouds
gathered in heavy black masses, dark as midnight,
and were pierced through with terrific
flashes of lightning. The rain fell in floods,
sweeping the hillside down into the valley, and
rolling all that was below onward in a resistless
mass toward the ocean. Down came the torrent
upon the heiau belonging to Kupa, tearing its
walls into fragments and washing Kupa and his
people into the harbor at the mouth of the valley.
Here the shark-god had gathered his people.
Sharks filled the bay and feasted upon Kupa and
his followers until the waters ran red and all were
destroyed. Hence came the legendary name for
that little harbor&mdash;Aikanaka, the place for man-eaters.</p>

<p>It is said in the legends that "when great clouds
gather on the mountains and a rainbow spans
the valley, look out for furious storms of wind and
rain which come suddenly, sweeping down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
valley." It also said in the legends that this
strange storm which came in such awful power
upon Kupa also spread out over the adjoining
lowlands, carrying great destruction everywhere,
but it paused at the tabu staff of Kamalo, and
rushed on either side of the sacred fence, not daring
to touch any one who dwelt therein. Therefore
Kamalo and his people were spared. The
legend has been called "Aikanaka" because of the
feast of the sharks on the human flesh swept down
into that harbor by the storm, but it seems more
fitting to name the story after the shark-god
Kauhuhu, who sent mighty storms and wrought
great destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p class="center">THE SHARK-MAN OF WAIPIO VALLEY</p>


<p>This is a story of Waipio Valley, the most
beautiful of all the valleys of the Hawaiian
Islands, and one of the most secluded. It is now,
as it has always been, very difficult of access.
The walls are a sheer descent of over a thousand
feet. In ancient times a narrow path slanted
along the face of the bluffs wherever foothold
could be found. In these later days the path has
been enlarged, and horse and rider can descend
into the valley's depths. In the upper end of the
valley is a long silver ribbon of water falling fifteen
hundred feet from the brow of a precipice
over which a mountain torrent swiftly hurls itself
to the fertile valley below. Other falls show the
convergence of other mountain streams to the
ocean outlet offered by the broad plains of Waipio.</p>

<p>Here in the long ago high chiefs dwelt and
sacred temples were built. From Waipio Valley
Moikeha and Laa-Mai-Kahiki sailed away on
their famous voyages to distant foreign lands. In
this valley dwelt the priest who in the times of
Maui was said to have the winds of heaven concealed
in his calabash. Raising the cover a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he sent gentle breezes in the direction of the opening.
Severe storms and hurricanes were granted
by swiftly opening the cover widely and letting
a chaotic mass of fierce winds escape. The stories
of magical powers of bird and fish as well as of
the strange deeds of powerful men are almost
innumerable. Not the least of the history-myths
of Waipio Valley is the story of Nanaue, the shark-man,
who was one of the cannibals of the ancient
time.</p>

<p>Ka-moho-alii was the king of all the sharks
which frequent Hawaiian waters. When he chose
to appear as a man he was always a chief of
dignified, majestic appearance. One day, while
swimming back and forth just beneath the surface
of the waters at the mouth of the valley, he
saw an exceedingly beautiful woman coming to
bathe in the white surf.</p>

<p>That night Ka-moho-alii came to the beach
black with lava sand, crawled out of the water,
and put on the form of a man. As a mighty chief
he walked through the valley and mingled with
the people. For days he entered into their sports
and pastimes and partook of their bounty, always
looking for the beautiful woman whom he
had seen bathing in the surf. When he found her
he came to her and won her to be his wife.</p>

<p>Kalei was the name of the woman who married
the strange chief. When the time came for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
child to be born to them, Ka-moho-alii charged
Kalei to keep careful watch of it and guard its
body continually from being seen of men, and
never allow the child to eat the flesh of any animal.
Then he disappeared, never permitting Kalei to
have the least suspicion that he was the king of
the sharks.</p>

<p>When the child was born, Kalei gave to him
the name "Nanaue." She was exceedingly surprised
to find an opening in his back. As the
child grew to manhood the opening developed
into a large shark-mouth in rows of fierce sharp
teeth.</p>

<p>From infancy to manhood Kalei protected
Nanaue by keeping his back covered with a fine
kapa cloak. She was full of fear as she saw
Nanaue plunge into the water and become a
shark. The mouth on his back opened for any
kind of prey. But she kept the terrible birthmark
of her son a secret hidden in the depths of
her own heart.</p>

<p>For years she prepared for him the common
articles of food, always shielding him from the
temptation to eat meat. But when he became
a man his grandfather took him to the men's
eating-house, where his mother could no longer
protect him. Meats of all varieties were given
to him in great abundance, yet he always wanted
more. His appetite was insatiable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>While under his mother's care he had been
taken to the pool of water into which the great
Waipio Falls poured its cascade of water. There
he bathed, and, changing himself into a shark,
caught the small fish which were playing around
him. His mother was always watching him to
give an alarm if any of the people came near to
the bathing-place.</p>

<p>As he became a man he avoided his companions
in all bathing and fishing. He went away by
himself. When the people were out in the deep
sea bathing or fishing, suddenly a fierce shark
would appear in their midst, biting and tearing
their limbs and dragging them down in the deep
water. Many of the people disappeared secretly,
and great terror filled the homes of Waipio.</p>

<p>Nanaue's mother alone was certain that he was
the cause of the trouble. He was becoming very
bold in his depredations. Sometimes he would
ask when his friends were going out in the sea;
then he would go to a place at some distance,
leap into the sea, and swiftly dash to intercept
the return of his friends to the shore. Perhaps
he would allay suspicion by appearing as a man
and challenge to a swimming-race. Diving suddenly,
he would in an instant become a shark and
destroy his fellow-swimmer.</p>

<p>The people felt that he had some peculiar power,
and feared him. One day, when their high chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
had called all the men of the valley to prepare
the taro patches for their future supply of food,
a fellow-workman standing by the side of Nanaue
tore his kapa cape from his shoulders. The men
behind cried out, "See the great shark-mouth!"
All the people came running together, shouting,
"A shark-man!" "A shark-man!"</p>

<p>Nanaue became very angry and snapped his
shark-teeth together. Then with bitter rage he
attacked those standing near him. He seized
one by the arm and bit it in two. He tore the
flesh of another in ragged gashes. Biting and
snapping from side to side he ran toward the sea.</p>

<p>The crowd of natives surrounded him and
blocked his way. He was thrown down and tied.
The mystery had now passed from the valley.
The people knew the cause of the troubles through
which they had been passing, and all crowded
around to see this wonderful thing, part man and
part shark.</p>

<p>The high chief ordered their largest oven to be
prepared, that Nanaue might be placed therein
and burned alive. The deep pit was quickly
cleaned out by many willing hands, and, with
much noise and rejoicing, fire was placed within
and the stones for heating were put in above the
fire. "We are ready for the shark-man," was
the cry.</p>

<p>During the confusion Nanaue quietly made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
plans to escape. Suddenly changing himself to
a shark, the cords which bound him fell off and
he rolled into one of the rivers which flowed from
the falls in the upper part of the valley.</p>

<p>None of the people dared to spring into the
water for a hand-to-hand fight with the monster.
They ran along the bank, throwing stones at
Nanaue and bruising him. They called for spears
that they might kill him, but he made a swift
rush to the sea and swam away, never again to
return to Waipio Valley.</p>

<p>Apparently Nanaue could not live long in the
ocean. The story says that he swam over to the
island of Maui and landed near the village Hana.
There he dwelt for some time, and married a
chiefess. Meanwhile he secretly killed and ate
some of the people. At last his appetite for
human flesh made him so bold that he caught a
beautiful young girl and carried her out into the
deep waters. There he changed himself into a
shark and ate her body in the sight of the people.</p>

<p>The Hawaiians became very angry. They
launched their canoes, and, throwing in all kinds
of weapons, pushed out to kill their enemy. But
he swam swiftly away, passing around the island
until at last he landed on Molokai.</p>

<span class="caption">A TRUSTY FISHERMAN</span>
</div>

<p>Again he joined himself to the people, and again
one by one those who went bathing and fishing
disappeared. The priests (kahunas) of the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>at last heard from their fellow-priests of the island
of Maui that there was a dangerous shark-man
roaming through the islands. They sent warning
to the people, urging all trusty fishermen to keep
strict watch. At last they saw Nanaue change
himself into a great fish. The fishermen waged
a fierce battle against him. They entangled him
in their nets, they pierced him with spears and
struck him with clubs until the waters were red
with his blood. They called on the gods of the
sea to aid them. They uttered prayers and incantations.
Soon Nanaue lost strength and could
not throw off the ropes which were tied around
him, nor could he break the nets in which he was
entangled.</p>

<p>The fishermen drew him to the shore, and the
people dragged the great shark body up the hill
Puu-mano. Then they cut the body into small
pieces and burned them in a great oven.</p>

<p>Thus died Nanaue, whose cannibal life was best
explained by giving to him in mythology the
awful appetite of an insatiable man-eating shark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class="center">THE STRANGE BANANA SKIN</p>


<p>Kukali, according to the folk-lore of Hawaii,
was born at Kalapana, the most southerly
point of the largest island of the Hawaiian group.
Kukali lived hundreds of years ago in the days
of the migrations of Polynesians from one group
of islands to another throughout the length and
breadth of the great Pacific Ocean. He visited
strange lands, now known under the general name,
Kahiki, or Tahiti. Here he killed the great bird
Halulu, found the deep bottomless pit in which
was a pool of the fabled water of life, married
the sister of Halulu, and returned to his old home.
All this he accomplished through the wonderful
power of a banana skin.</p>

<p>Kukali's father was a priest, or kahuna, of
great wisdom and ability, who taught his children
how to exercise strange and magical powers. To
Kukali he gave a banana with the impressive
charge to preserve the skin whenever he ate the
fruit, and be careful that it was always under
his control. He taught Kukali the wisdom of
the makers of canoes and also how to select the
fine-grained lava for stone knives and hatchets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and fashion the blade to the best shape. He instructed
the young man in the prayers and incantations
of greatest efficacy and showed him
charms which would be more powerful than any
charms his enemies might use in attempting to
destroy him, and taught him those omens which
were too powerful to be overcome. Thus Kukali
became a wizard, having great confidence in his
ability to meet the craft of the wise men of distant
islands.</p>

<p>Kukali went inland through the forests and up
the mountains, carrying no food save the banana
which his father had given him. Hunger came,
and he carefully stripped back the skin and ate
the banana, folding the skin once more together.
In a little while the skin was filled with fruit.
Again and again he ate, and as his hunger was
satisfied the fruit always again filled the skin,
which he was careful never to throw away or lose.</p>

<p>The fever of sea-roving was in the blood of the
Hawaiian people in those days, and Kukali's
heart burned within him with the desire to visit
the far-away lands about which other men told
marvelous tales and from which came strangers
like to the Hawaiians in many ways.</p>

<p>After a while he went to the forests and selected
trees approved by the omens, and with many
prayers fashioned a great canoe in which to embark
upon his journey. The story is not told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the days passed on the great stretches of water
as he sailed on and on, guided by the sun in the
day and the stars in the night, until he came to
the strange lands about which he had dreamed
for years.</p>

<p>His canoe was drawn up on the shore and he
lay down for rest. Before falling asleep he secreted
his magic banana in his malo, or loin-cloth,
and then gave himself to deep slumber.
His rest was troubled with strange dreams, but
his weariness was great and his eyes heavy, and
he could not arouse himself to meet the dangers
which were swiftly surrounding him.</p>

<p>A great bird which lived on human flesh was
the god of the land to which he had come. The
name of the bird was Halulu. Each feather of
its wings was provided with talons and seemed
to be endowed with human powers. Nothing
like this bird was ever known or seen in the beautiful
Hawaiian Islands. But here in the mysterious
foreign land it had its deep valley, walled
in like the valley of the Arabian Nights, over
which the great bird hovered looking into the
depths for food. A strong wind always attended
the coming of Halulu when he sought the valley
for his victims.</p>

<p>Kukali was lifted on the wings of the bird-god
and carried to this hole and quietly laid on the
ground to finish his hour of deep sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>When Kukali awoke he found himself in the
shut-in valley with many companions who had
been captured by the great bird and placed in this
prison hole. They had been without food and
were very weak. Now and then one of the number
would lie down to die. Halulu, the bird-god,
would perch on a tree which grew on the edge of
the precipice and let down its wing to sweep
across the floor of the valley and pick up the
victims lying on the ground. Those who were
strong could escape the feathers as they brushed
over the bottom and hide in the crevices in
the walls, but day by day the weakest of the
prisoners were lifted out and prepared for Halulu's
feast.</p>

<p>Kukali pitied the helpless state of his fellow-prisoners
and prepared his best incantations and
prayers to help him overcome the great bird.
He took his wonderful banana and fed all the
people until they were very strong. He taught
them how to seek stones best fitted for the manufacture
of knives and hatchets. Then for days
they worked until they were all well armed with
sharp stone weapons.</p>

<p>While Kukali and his fellow-prisoners were
making preparation for the final struggle, the
bird-god had often come to his perch and put
his wing down into the valley, brushing the
feathers back and forth to catch his prey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Frequently the search was fruitless. At last he
became very impatient, and sent his strongest
feathers along the precipitous walls, seeking for
victims.</p>

<p>Kukali and his companions then ran out from
their hiding-places and fought the strong feathers,
cutting them off and chopping them into small
pieces.</p>

<p>Halulu cried out with pain and anger, and sent
feather after feather into the prison. Soon one
wing was entirely destroyed. Then the other
wing was broken to pieces and the bird-god in
his insane wrath put down a strong leg armed
with great talons. Kukali uttered mighty invocations
and prepared sacred charms for the protection
of his friends.</p>

<p>After a fierce battle they cut off the leg and
destroyed the talons. Then came the struggle
with the remaining leg and claws, but Kukali's
friends had become very bold. They fearlessly
gathered around this enemy, hacking and pulling
until the bird-god, screaming with pain, fell into
the pit among the prisoners, who quickly cut the
body into fragments.</p>

<p>The prisoners made steps in the walls, and by
the aid of vines climbed out of their prison.
When they had fully escaped, they gathered great
piles of branches and trunks of trees and threw
them into the prison until the body of the bird-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>god
was covered. Fire was thrown down and
Halulu was burned to ashes. Thus Kukali taught
by his charms that Halulu could be completely
destroyed.</p>

<p>But two of the breast feathers of the burning
Halulu flew away to his sister, who lived in a great
hole which had no bottom. The name of this
sister was Namakaeha. She belonged to the
family of Pele, the goddess of volcanic fires, who
had journeyed to Hawaii and taken up her home
in the crater of the volcano Kilauea.</p>

<p>Namakaeha smelled smoke on the feathers
which came to her, and knew that her brother was
dead. She also knew that he could have been
conquered only by one possessing great magical
powers. So she called to his people: "Who is the
great kupua [wizard] who has killed my brother?
Oh, my people, keep careful watch."</p>

<p>Kukali was exploring all parts of the strange
land in which he had already found marvelous
adventures. By and by he came to the great
pit in which Namakaeha lived. He could not
see the bottom, so he told his companions he was
going down to see what mysteries were concealed
in this hole without a bottom. They made a rope
of the hau tree bark. Fastening one end around
his body he ordered his friends to let him down.
Uttering prayers and incantations he went down
and down until, owing to counter incantations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Namakaeha's priests, who had been watching, the
rope broke and he fell.</p>

<p>Down he went swiftly, but, remembering the
prayer which a falling man must use to keep him
from injury, he cried, "O Ku! guard my life!"</p>

<p>In the ancient Hawaiian mythology there was
frequent mention of "the water of life." Sometimes
the sick bathed in it and were healed.
Sometimes it was sprinkled upon the unconscious,
bringing them back to life. Kukali's incantation
was of great power, for it threw him into a pool
of the water of life and he was saved.</p>

<p>One of the kahunas (priests) caring for Namakaeha
was a very great wizard. He saw the
wonderful preservation of Kukali and became his
friend. He warned Kukali against eating anything
that was ripe, because it would be poison,
and even the most powerful charms could not
save him.</p>

<p>Kukali thanked him and went out among the
people. He had carefully preserved his wonderful
banana skin, and was able to eat apparently
ripe fruit and yet be perfectly safe.</p>

<p>The kahunas of Namakaeha tried to overcome
him and destroy him, but he conquered them,
killed those who were bad, and entered into
friendship with those who were good.</p>

<p>At last he came to the place where the great
chiefess dwelt. Here he was tested in many ways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
He accepted the fruits offered him, but always
ate the food in his magic banana. Thus he preserved
his strength and conquered even the chiefess
and married her. After living with her for
a time he began to long for his old home in
Hawaii. Then he persuaded her to do as her
relative Pele had already done, and the family,
taking their large canoe, sailed away to Hawaii,
their future home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN</p>

<blockquote><p>This is not a Hawaiian legend. It was written to
show the superstitions of the Hawaiians, and in that respect
it is accurate and worthy of preservation.</p></blockquote>


<p>Far away in New England one of the rugged
mountain-sides has for many years been
marked with the profile of a grand face. A noble
brow, deep-set eyes, close-shut lips, Roman nose,
and chin standing in full relief against a clear
sky, made a landmark renowned throughout the
country. The story is told of a boy who lived
in the valley from which the face of the Old Man
of the Mountain could be most clearly seen.
As the years passed, the boy grew into a man
of sterling character. When at last death came
and the casket opened to receive the body of an
old man, universally revered, the friends saw the
likeness to the stone features of the Old Man of
the Mountain, and recognized the source of the
inspiration which had made one life useful and
honored.</p>

<p>Near Honolulu, just beyond one of the great
sugar plantations, is a ledge of lava deposited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>centuries ago. The lava was piled up into
mountains, now dissolved into slopes of the richest
sugar-land in the world. And yet sometimes
the hard lava, refusing to disintegrate, thrusts
itself out from the hillsides in ledges of grotesque
form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/094.jpg" width="600" height="316" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>On one of these ancient lava ridges was the
outline of an old man's face, to which the Hawaiians
have given the name, "The Old Man of
the Mountain." The laborers on the sugar-plantations,
the passengers on the railroad trains,
and the natives who still cling to their scattered
homes sometimes have looked with superstitious
awe upon the face made without hands. In the
days gone by they have called it the "Akuapohaku"
(the stone god). Shall we hear the
story of Kamakau, who at some time in the
indefinite past dwelt in the shadow of the stone
face?</p>

<p>Kamakau means "the afraid." His name
came to him as a child. He was a shrinking,
sensitive, imaginative little fellow. He was
surrounded by influences which turned his
imagination into the paths of most unwholesome
superstition. But beyond the beliefs of most
of his fellows, in his own nature he was keenly
appreciative of mysterious things. There was
a spirit voice in every wind rustling the tops
of the trees. Spirit faces appeared in unnumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>caricatures
of human outline whenever
he lay on the grass and watched the sunlight
sift between the leaves. Everything he looked
upon or heard assumed some curious form
of life. The clouds were most mysterious of all,
for they so frequently piled up mass upon mass
of grandeur, in such luxurious magnificence and
such prodigal display of color, that his power
of thought lost itself in his almost daily dream
of some time-wandering in the shadow valleys of
the precipitous mountains of heaven. Here he
saw also strangely symmetrical forms of man and
bird and fish. Sometimes cloud forests outlined
themselves against the blue sky, and then again
at times separated by months and even years, the
lights of the volcano-goddess, Pele, glorified her
path as she wandered in the spirit land, flashing
from cloud-peak to cloud-peak, while the thunder
voices of the great gods rolled in mighty volumes
of terrific impressiveness. Even in the night
Kamakau felt that the innumerable stars were
the eyes of the aumakuas (the spirits of the ancestors).
It was not strange that such a child
should continually think that he saw spirit forms
which were invisible to his companions. It is no
wonder that he fancied he heard voices of the
menehunes (fairies), which his companions could
never understand. As he shrunk from places
where it seemed to him the spirits dwelt, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
companions called him "Kamakau," "the afraid."
When he grew older he necessarily became keenly
alive to all objects of Hawaiian superstition. He
never could escape the overwhelming presence of
the thousand and more gods which were supposed
to inhabit the Hawaiian land and sea. The omens
drawn from sacrifices, the voices from the bamboo
dwelling-places of the oracles, the chants of
the prophets, and powers of praying to death he
accepted with unquestioning faith.</p>

<p>Two men were hunting in the forests of the
mountains of Oahu. Tired with the long chase
after the oo, the bird with the rare yellow feathers
from which the feather cloaks of the highest
chiefs were made, they laid aside spears and
snares and lay down for a rest. "I want the
valley of the stone god," said one: "its fertile
fields would make just the increase needed for my
retainers, and the 'moi,' the king, would give me
the land if Kamakau were out of the way."</p>

<p>"Are there any other members of his family,
O Inaina, who could resist your claim?"</p>

<p>"No, my friend Kokua. He is the only important
chief in the valley."</p>

<p>"Pray him to death," was Kokua's sententious
advice.</p>

<p>"Good; I'll do it," said Inaina: "he is one who
can easily be prayed to death. 'The Afraid'
will soon die."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you will give me the small fish-pond nearest
my own coral fish-walls I will be your messenger,"
said Kokua.</p>

<p>"Ah, that also is good," replied Inaina, after
a moment's thought. "I will give you the small
pond, and you must give the small thoughts,
the hints, to his friends that powerful priests are
praying Kamakau to death. All this must be
very mysterious. No name can be mentioned,
and you and I must be Kamakau's good friends."</p>

<p>It must be remembered that land tenure in
ancient Hawaii was almost the same as that of
the European feudal system. Occupancy depended
upon the will of the high chief. He gave
or took away at his own pleasure. The under-chiefs
held the land as if it belonged to them, and
were seldom troubled as long as the wishes of the
high chief, or king, were carried out. Inaina felt
secure in the use of his present property, and
believed that he could easily find favor and obtain
the land held by the Kamakau family if Kamakau
himself could be removed. Without much
further conference the two hunters returned to
their homes. Inaina at once sought his family
priest and stated his wish to have Kamakau
prayed to death. They decided that the first
step should be taken that night. It was absolutely
necessary that something which had been
a part of the body of Kamakau should be ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>tained.
The priest appointed his confidential
hunter of sacrifices to undertake this task. This
servant of the temple was usually sent out to
find human sacrifices to be slain and offered
before the great gods on special occasions. As
the darkness came on he crept near the grass
house of Kamakau and watched for an opportunity
of seizing what he wanted. The two most
desired things in the art of praying to death were
either a lock of hair from the head of the victim
or a part of the spittle, usually well guarded by
the trusted retainers who had charge of the
spittoon.</p>

<p>It chanced to be "Awa night" for Kamakau,
and the chief, having drunk heavily of the drug,
had thrown himself on a mat and rolled near the
grass walls. With great ingenuity the hunter of
sacrifices located the chief and worked a hole
through the thatch. Then with his sharp bone
knife he sawed off a large lock of Kamakau's
hair. When this was done he was about to creep
away, but a native came near. Instantly grunting
like a hog, he worked his way into the darkness.
He saw outlined against the sky in the
hands of the native the chief's spittoon. In a
moment the hunter of sacrifices saw his opportunity.
His past training in lying in wait and
capturing men for sacrifice stood him in good
stead at this time. The unsuspecting spittoon-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>carrier
was seized by the throat and quickly
strangled. The spittoon in falling from the
retainer's hand had not been overturned. Exultant
at his success, the hunter of sacrifices sped
away in the darkness and placed his trophies in
the hands of the priest. The next morning there
was a great outcry in Kamakau's village. The
dead body was found as soon as dawn crept
over the valley, and the hand-polished family
calabash was completely lost. When the people
went to Kamakau's house with the report of
the death of his retainer, they soon saw that the
head of their chief had been dishonored. A great
feeling of fear took possession of the village.
Kamakau's priest hurried to the village temple
to utter prayers and incantations against the
enemy who had committed such an outrage.</p>

<p>Kokua soon heard the news and came to comfort
his neighbor. After the greeting, "Auwe!
auwe!" (Alas! alas!) Kokua said: "This is surely
praying to death, and the gods have already
given you over into the hands of your enemy.
You will die. Very soon you will die." Soon
Inaina and other chiefs came with their retainers.
Among high and low the terrible statement was
whispered: "Kamakau is being prayed to death,
and no man knows his enemy." Many a strong
man has gone to a bed of continued illness, and
some have crossed the dark valley into the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of death, even in these days of enlightened
civilization, simply frightened into the illness
or death by the strong statements of friends
and acquaintances. Such is the make-up of
the minds of men that they are easily affected
by the mysterious suggestions of others. It is
purely a matter of mind-murder.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that in the days of the long ago
Kamakau, moved by the terror of his friends
and horrible suggestions of his two enemies, soon
felt a great weakness conquering him. His
natural disposition, his habit of seeing and hearing
gods and spirits in everything around him,
made it easy for him to yield to the belief that
he was being prayed to death. His strength
left him. He could take no food. A strange
paralysis seemed to take possession of him.
Mind and body were almost benumbed. He
was really in the hands of unconscious mesmerists,
who were putting him into a magnetic sleep, from
which he was never expected to awake. It is a
question to be answered only when all earthly
problems have been solved. How many of the
people prayed to death have really been dissected
and prepared for burial while at first
under mesmeric influences! The people gathered
around Kamakau's thatched house. They thought
that he would surely die before the next morning
dawned. Inaina and Kokua were lying on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
grass under the shade of a great candlenut-tree,
quietly talking about the speedy success of their
undertaking. A little girl was playing near them.
It was Kamakau's little Aloha. This was all the
name so far given to her. She was "My Aloha,"
"my dear one," to both father and mother. She
heard a word uttered incautiously. Inaina had
spoken with the accent of success and his voice
was louder than he thought. He said, "We
have great strength if we kill Kamakau." The
child fled to her father. She found him in the
half-unconscious state already described. She
shook him. She called to him. She pulled his
hands, and covered his face with kisses. Her
tears poured over his hot, dry skin. Kamakau
was aroused by the shock. He sat up, forgetting
all the expectation of death.</p>

<p>Out through the doorway he glanced toward
the west. The sinking sun was sending its
most glorious beams into the grand clouds,
while just beneath, reflecting the glory, lay the
Old Man of the Mountain. The stone face
was magnificent in its setting. The unruffled
brow, the never-closing eyes, the firm lips, stood
out in bold relief against the glory which was
over and beyond them. Kamakau caught the
inspiration. It seemed to his vivid imagination
as if ten thousand good spirits were gathered in
the heavens to fight for him. He leaped to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
feet, strength came back into the wearied
muscles, a new will-power took possession of
him, and he cried: "I will not die! I will not die!
The stone god is more powerful than the priests
who pray to death!" His will had broken
away from its chains, and, unfettered from all
fear, Kamakau went forth to greet the wondering
people and take up again the position of
influence held among the chiefs of Oahu. The
lesson is still needed in these beautiful ocean-bound
islands that praying to death means either
the use of poison or the attempt to terrify the
victim by strong mental forces enslaving the
will. In either case the aroused will is powerful

<h2>XI</h2>

<p class="center">HAWAIIAN GHOST TESTING</p>


<p>Manoa Valley for centuries has been to
the Hawaiians the royal palace of rainbows.
The mountains at the head of the valley were
gods whose children were the divine wind and
rain from whom was born the beautiful rainbow-maiden
who plays in and around the valley day
and night whenever misty showers are touched
by sunlight or moonlight.</p>

<p>The natives of the valley usually give her the
name of Kahalaopuna, or The Hala of Puna.
Sometimes, however, they call her Kaikawahine
Anuenue, or The Rainbow Maiden. The rainbow,
the anuenue, marks the continuation of the
legendary life of Kahala.</p>

<p>The legend of Kahala is worthy of record in itself,
but connected with the story is a very interesting
account of an attempt to discover and
capture ghosts according to the methods supposed
to be effective by the Hawaiian witch
doctors or priests of the long, long ago.</p>

<p>The legends say that the rainbow-maiden had
two lovers, one from Waikiki, and one from
Kamoiliili, half-way between Manoa and Waikiki.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Both wanted the beautiful arch to rest over their
homes, and the maiden, the descendant of the
gods, to dwell therein.</p>

<p>Kauhi, the Waikiki chief, was of the family
of Mohoalii, the shark-god, and partook of the
shark's cruel nature. He became angry with
the rainbow-maiden and killed her and buried
the body, but her guardian god, Pueo, the owl,
scratched away the earth and brought her to life.
Several times this occurred, and the owl each
time restored the buried body to the wandering
spirit. At last the chief buried the body deep
down under the roots of a large koa-tree. The
owl-god scratched and pulled, but the roots of
the tree were many and strong. His claws were
entangled again and again. At last he concluded
that life must be extinct and so deserted the place.</p>

<p>The spirit of the murdered girl was wandering
around hoping that it could be restored to the
body, and not be compelled to descend to Milu,
the Under-world of the Hawaiians. Po was sometimes
the Under-world, and Milu was the god
ruling over Po. The Hawaiian ghosts did not
go to the home of the dead as soon as they were
separated from the body. Many times, as
when rendered unconscious, it was believed
that the spirit had left the body, but for some
reason had been able to come back into it and
enjoy life among friends once more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Kahala, the rainbow-maiden, was thus restored
several times by the owl-god, but with
this last failure it seemed to be certain that
the body would grow cold and stiff before
the spirit could return. The spirit hastened
to and fro in great distress, trying to attract
attention.</p>

<p>If a wandering spirit could interest some one
to render speedy aid, the ancient Hawaiians
thought that a human being could place the
spirit back in the body. Certain prayers and
incantations were very effective in calling the
spirit back to its earthly home. The Samoans
had the same thought concerning the restoration
of life to one who had become unconscious,
and had a special prayer, which was known as
the prayer of life, by which the spirit was persuaded
to return into its old home. The Hervey
Islanders also had this same conception of any
unconscious condition. They thought the spirit
left the body but when persuaded to do so returned
and brought the body back to life. They
have a story of a woman who, like the rainbow-maiden,
was restored to life several times.</p>

<p>The spirit of Kahala was almost discouraged.
The shadows of real death were encompassing her,
and the feeling of separation from the body
was becoming more and more permanent. At
last she saw a noble young chief approaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
He was Mahana, the chief of Kamoiliili. The
spirit hovered over him and around him and
tried to impress her anguish upon him.</p>

<p>Mahana felt the call of distress, and attributed
it to the presence of a ghost, or aumakua,
a ghost-god. He was conscious of an influence
leading him toward a large koa-tree. There
he found the earth disturbed by the owl-god.
He tore aside the roots and discovered the
body bruised and disfigured and yet recognized
it as the body of the rainbow-maiden whom he
had loved.</p>

<p>In the King Kalakaua version of the story
Mahana is represented as taking the body, which
was still warm, to his home in Kamoiliili.</p>

<p>Mahana's elder brother was a kahuna, or witch-doctor,
of great celebrity. He was called at once
to pronounce the prayers and invocations necessary
for influencing the spirit and the body to
reunite. Long and earnestly the kahuna practised
all the arts with which he was acquainted and
yet completely failed. In his anxiety he called
upon the spirits of two sisters who, as aumakuas,
watched over the welfare of Mahana's clan.
These spirit-sisters brought the spirit of the
rainbow-maiden to the bruised body and induced
it to enter the feet. Then, by using the forces
of spirit-land, while the kahuna chanted and
used his charms, they pushed the spirit of Kahala<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
slowly up the body until "the soul was once more
restored to its beautiful tenement."</p>

<p>The spirit-sisters then aided Mahana in restoring
the wounded body to its old vigor and
beauty. Thus many days passed in close comradeship
between Kahala and the young chief,
and they learned to care greatly for one another.</p>

<p>But while Kauhi lived it was unsafe for it to
be known that Kahala was alive. Mahana determined
to provoke Kauhi to personal combat;
therefore he sought the places which Kauhi frequented
for sport and gambling. Bitter words
were spoken and fierce anger aroused until at
last, by the skilful use of Kahala's story, Mahana
led Kauhi to admit that he had killed the
rainbow-maiden and buried her body.</p>

<p>Mahana said that Kahala was now alive and
visiting his sisters.</p>

<p>Kauhi declared that if there was any one visiting
Mahana's home it must be an impostor. In
his anger against Mahana he determined a more
awful death than could possibly come from any
personal conflict. He was so sure that Kahala
was dead that he offered to be baked alive in one
of the native imus, or ovens, if she should be produced
before the king and the principal chiefs
of the district. Akaaka, the grandfather of
Kahala, one of the mountain-gods of Manoa
Valley, was to be one of the judges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>This proposition suited Mahana better than
a conflict, in which there was a possibility of
losing his own life.</p>

<p>Kauhi now feared that some deception might
be practised. His proposition had been so
eagerly accepted that he became suspicious;
therefore he consulted the sorcerers of his own
family. They agreed that it was possible for
some powerful kahuna to present the ghost of
the murdered maiden and so deceive the judges.
They decided that it was necessary to be prepared
to test the ghosts.</p>

<p>If it could be shown that ghosts were present,
then the aid of "spirit catchers" from the land
of Milu could be invoked. Spirits would seize
these venturesome ghosts and carry them away
to the spirit-land, where special punishments
should be meted out to them. It was supposed
that "spirit catchers" were continually
sent out by Milu, king of the Under-world.</p>

<p>How could these ghosts be detected? They
would certainly appear in human form and be
carefully safeguarded. The chief sorcerer of
Kauhi's family told Kauhi to make secretly a
thorough test. This could be done by taking
the large and delicate leaves of the ape-plant
and spreading them over the place where Kahala
must walk and sit before the judges. A human
being could not touch these leaves so carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
placed without tearing and bruising them. A
ghost walking upon them could not make any
impression. Untorn leaves would condemn
Mahana to the ovens to be baked alive, and the
spirit catchers would be called by the sorcerers
to seize the escaped ghost and carry it back to
spirit-land. Of course, if some other maid of the
islands had pretended to be Kahala, that could
be easily determined by her divine ancestor
Akaaka. The trial was really a test of ghosts,
for the presence of Kahala as a spirit in her former
human likeness was all that Kauhi and his chief
sorcerer feared. The leaves were selected with
great care and secretly placed so that no one
should touch them but Kahala. There was
great interest in this strange contest for a home
in a burning oven. The imus had been prepared:
the holes had been dug, and the stones and wood
necessary for the sacrifice laid close at hand.</p>

<p>The king and judges were in their places. The
multitude of retainers stood around at a respectful
distance. Kauhi and his chief sorcerer were
placed where they could watch closely every
movement of the maiden who should appear
before the judgment-seat.</p>

<p>Kahala, the rainbow-maiden, with all the
beauty of her past girlhood restored to her,
drew near, attended by the two spirit-sisters
who had saved and protected her. The spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
knew at once the ghost test by which Kahala
was to be tried. They knew also that she had
nothing to fear, but they must not be discovered.
The test applied to Kahala would only make more
evident the proof that she was a living human
being, but that same test would prove that they
were ghosts, and the spirit-catchers would be
called at once and they would be caught and
carried away for punishment. The spirit-sisters
could not try to escape. Any such attempt would
arouse suspicion and they would be surely seized.
The ghost-testing was a serious ordeal for Kahala
and her friends.</p>

<p>The spirit-sisters whispered to Kahala, telling
her the purpose attending the use of the ape
leaves and asking her to break as many of them
on either side of her as she could without attracting
undue attention. Thus she could aid
her own cause and also protect the sister-spirits.
Slowly and with great dignity the beautiful
rainbow-maiden and her friends passed through
the crowds of eager attendants to their places
before the king. Kahala bruised and broke as
many of the leaves as she could quietly. She
was recognized at once as the child of the divine
rain and wind of Manoa Valley. There was no
question concerning her bodily presence. The
torn leaves afforded ample and indisputable
testimony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Kauhi, in despair, recognized the girl whom
he had several times tried to slay. In bitter disappointment
at the failure of his ghost-test the
chief sorcerer, as the Kalakaua version of this
legend says, "declared that he saw and felt
the presence of spirits in some manner connected
with her." These spirits, he claimed, must be
detected and punished.</p>

<p>A second form of ghost-testing was proposed by
Akaaka, the mountain-god. This was a method
frequently employed throughout all the islands
of the Hawaiian group. It was believed that
any face reflected in a pool or calabash of water
was a spirit face. Many times had ghosts been
discovered in this way. The face in the water
had been grasped by the watcher, crushed between
his hands, and the spirit destroyed.</p>

<p>The chief sorcerer eagerly ordered a calabash
of water to be quickly brought and placed before
him. In his anxiety to detect and seize the
spirits who might be attending Kahala he forgot
about himself and leaned over the calabash. His
own spirit face was the only one reflected on the
surface of the water. This spirit face was believed
to be his own true spirit escaping for the
moment from the body and bathing in the liquid
before him. Before he could leap back and restore
his spirit to his body Akaaka leaped forward,
thrust his hands down into the water and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
seized and crushed this spirit face between his
mighty hands. Thus it was destroyed before it
could return to its home of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>The chief sorcerer fell dead by the side of the
calabash by means of which he had hoped to destroy
the friends of the rainbow-maiden.</p>

<p>In this trial of the ghosts the two most powerful
methods of making a test as far as known
among the ancient Hawaiians were put in
practice.</p>

<p>Kauhi was punished for his crimes against
Kahala. He was baked alive in the imu prepared
on his own land at Waikiki. His lands
and retainers were given to Kahala and Mahana.</p>

<p>The story of Kahala and her connection with
the rainbows and waterfalls of Manoa Valley
has been told from time to time in the homes of
the nature-loving native residents of the valley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p class="center">HOW MILU BECAME THE KING OF
GHOSTS</p>


<p>Lono was a chief living on the western side
of the island Hawaii. He had a very red
skin and strange-looking eyes. His choice of occupation
was farming. This man had never
been sick. One time he was digging with the
oo, a long sharp-pointed stick or spade. A man
passed and admired him. The people said,
"Lono has never been sick." The man said,
"He will be sick."</p>

<p>Lono was talking about that man and at the
same time struck his oo down with force and
cut his foot. He shed much blood, and fainted,
falling to the ground. A man took a pig, went
after the stranger, and let the pig go, which
ran to this man. The stranger was Kamaka,
a god of healing. He turned and went back at
the call of the messenger, taking some popolo
fruit and leaves in his cloak. When he came to
the injured man he asked for salt, which he
pounded into the fruit and leaves and placed in
coco cloth and bound it on the wound, leaving
it a long time. Then he went away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>As he journeyed on he heard heavy breathing,
and turning saw Lono, who said, "You have
helped me, and so I have left my lands in the care
of my friends, directing them what to do, and
have hastened after you to learn how to heal
other people."</p>

<p>The god said, "Lono, open your mouth!"
This Lono did, and the god spat in his mouth, so
that the saliva could be taken into every part
of Lono's body. Thus a part of the god became
a part of Lono, and he became very skilful in the
use of all healing remedies. He learned about
the various diseases and the medicines needed
for each. The god and Lono walked together,
Lono receiving new lessons along the way, passing
through the districts of Kau, Puna, Hilo,
and then to Hamakua.</p>

<p>The god said, "It is not right for us to stay
together. You can never accomplish anything
by staying with me. You must go to a separate
place and give yourself up to healing people."</p>

<p>Lono turned aside to dwell in Waimanu and
Waipio Valleys and there began to practise
healing, becoming very noted, while the god
Kamaka made his home at Ku-kui-haele.</p>

<p>This god did not tell the other gods of the
medicines that he had taught Lono. One of
the other gods, Kalae, was trying to find some
way to kill Milu, and was always making him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sick. Milu, chief of Waipio, heard of the skill
of Lono. Some had been sick even to death,
and Lono had healed them. Therefore Milu
sent a messenger to Lono who responded at once,
came and slapped Milu all over the body, and
said: "You are not ill. Obey me and you shall
be well."</p>

<p>Then he healed him from all the sickness inside
the body caused by Kalae. But there
was danger from outside, so he said: "You
must build a ti-leaf house and dwell there quietly
for some time, letting your disease rest. If a
company should come by the house making sport,
with a great noise, do not go out, because when
you go they will come up and get you for your
death. Do not open the ti leaves and look out.
The day you do this you shall die."</p>

<p>Some time passed and the chief remained in
the house, but one day there was the confused
noise of many people talking and shouting around
his house. He did not forget the command of
Lono. Two birds were sporting in a wonderful
way in the sky above the forest. This continued
all day until it was dark.</p>

<p>Then another long time passed and again
Waipio was full of resounding noises. A great
bird appeared in the sky resplendent in all kinds
of feathers, swaying from side to side over the
valley, from the top of one precipice across to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the top of another, in grand flights passing over
the heads of the people, who shouted until the
valley re-echoed with the sound.</p>

<p>Milu became tired of that great noise and
could not patiently obey his physician, so he
pushed aside some of the ti leaves of his house
and looked out upon the bird. That was the
time when the bird swept down upon the house,
thrusting a claw under Milu's arm, tearing out
his liver. Lono saw this and ran after the bird,
but it flew swiftly to a deep pit in the lava on
one side of the valley and dashed inside, leaving
blood spread on the stones. Lono came, saw the
blood, took it and wrapped it in a piece of tapa
cloth and returned to the place where the chief
lay almost dead. He poured some medicine into
the wound and pushed the tapa and blood inside.
Milu was soon healed.</p>

<p>The place where the bird hid with the liver of
Milu is called to this day Ke-ake-o-Milu ("The
liver of Milu"). When this death had passed
away he felt very well, even as before his trouble.</p>

<p>Then Lono told him that another death threatened
him and would soon appear. He must dwell
in quietness.</p>

<p>For some time Milu was living in peace and
quiet after this trouble. Then one day the
surf of Waipio became very high, rushing from
far out even to the sand, and the people entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
into the sport of surf-riding with great joy and
loud shouts. This noise continued day by day,
and Milu was impatient of the restraint and forgot
the words of Lono. He went out to bathe
in the surf.</p>

<p>When he came to the place of the wonderful
surf he let the first and second waves go by,
and as the third came near he launched himself
upon it while the people along the beach
shouted uproariously. He went out again into
deeper water, and again came in, letting the first
and second waves go first. As he came to the
shore the first and second waves were hurled
back from the shore in a great mass against the
wave upon which he was riding. The two
great masses of water struck and pounded Milu,
whirling and crowding him down, while the surf-board
was caught in the raging, struggling
waters and thrown out toward the shore. Milu
was completely lost in the deep water.</p>

<p>The people cried: "Milu is dead! The chief
is dead!" The god Kalae thought he had killed
Milu, so he with the other poison-gods went on
a journey to Mauna Loa. Kapo and Pua, the
poison-gods, or gods of death, of the island Maui,
found them as they passed, and joined the company.
They discovered a forest on Molokai,
and there as kupua spirits, or ghost bodies, entered
into the trees of that forest, so the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
became the kupua bodies. They were the medicinal
or poison qualities in the trees.</p>

<p>Lono remained in Waipio Valley, becoming
the ancestor and teacher of all the good healing
priests of Hawaii, but Milu became the ruler
of the Under-world, the place where the spirits of
the dead had their home after they were driven
away from the land of the living. Many people
came to him from time to time.</p>

<p>He established ghostly sports like those which
his subjects had enjoyed before death. They
played the game kilu with polished cocoanut
shells, spinning them over a smooth surface to
strike a post set up in the centre. He taught konane,
a game commonly called "Hawaiian checkers,"
but more like the Japanese game of "Go."
He permitted them to gamble, betting all the
kinds of property found in ghost-land. They
boxed and wrestled; they leaped from precipices
into ghostly swimming-pools; they feasted
and fought, sometimes attempting to slay each
other. Thus they lived the ghost life as they
had lived on earth. Sometimes the ruler was
forgotten and the ancient Hawaiians called the
Under-world by his name&mdash;Milu. The New
Zealanders frequently gave their Under-world
the name "Miru." They also supposed that
the ghosts feasted and sported as they had done
while living.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XIII</h2>

<p class="center">A VISIT TO THE KING OF GHOSTS</p>


<p>When any person lay in an unconscious
state, it was supposed by the ancient
Hawaiians that death had taken possession of the
body and opened the door for the spirit to depart.
Sometimes if the body lay like one asleep
the spirit was supposed to return to its old home.
One of the Hawaiian legends weaves their deep-rooted
faith in the spirit-world into the expressions
of one who seemed to be permitted to visit
that ghost-land and its king. This legend belonged
to the island of Maui and the region near
the village Lahaina. Thus was the story told:</p>

<p>Ka-ilio-hae (the wild dog) had been sick for
days and at last sank into a state of unconsciousness.
The spirit of life crept out of the body
and finally departed from the left eye into a corner
of the house, buzzing like an insect. Then
he stopped and looked back over the body he
had left. It appeared to him like a massive
mountain. The eyes were deep caves, into which
the ghost looked. Then the spirit became
afraid and went outside and rested on the roof
of the house. The people began to wail loudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and the ghost fled from the noise to a cocoanut-tree
and perched like a bird in the branches.
Soon he felt the impulse of the spirit-land moving
him away from his old home. So he leaped from
tree to tree and flew from place to place wandering
toward Kekaa, the place from which the
ghosts leave the island of Maui for their home
in the permanent spirit-land&mdash;the Under-world.</p>

<p>As he came near this doorway to the spirit-world
he met the ghost of a sister who had died
long before, and to whom was given the power
of sometimes turning a ghost back to its body
again. She was an aumakua-ho-ola (a spirit
making alive). She called to Ka-ilio-hae and
told him to come to her house and dwell for a
time. But she warned him that when her husband
was at home he must not yield to any invitation
from him to enter their house, nor could
he partake of any of the food which her husband
might urge him to eat. The home and the food
would be only the shadows of real things, and
would destroy his power of becoming alive again.</p>

<p>The sister said, "When my husband comes to
eat the food of the spirits and to sleep the sleep
of ghosts, then I will go with you and you shall
see all the spirit-land of our island and see the
king of ghosts."</p>

<p>The ghost-sister led Ka-ilio-hae into the place
of whirlwinds, a hill where he heard the voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of many spirits planning to enjoy all the sports
of their former life. He listened with delight and
drew near to the multitude of happy spirits.
Some were making ready to go down to the sea
for the hee-nalu (surf-riding). Others were already
rolling the ulu-maika (the round stone
discs for rolling along the ground). Some were
engaged in the mokomoko, or umauma (boxing),
and the kulakulai (wrestling), and the honuhonu
(pulling with hands), and the loulou (pulling with
hooked fingers), and other athletic sports.</p>

<p>Some of the spirits were already grouped in
the shade of trees, playing the gambling games
in which they had delighted when alive. There
was the stone konane-board (somewhat like
checkers), and the puepue-one (a small sand
mound in which was concealed some object),
and the puhenehene (the hidden stone under
piles of kapa), and the many other trials of skill
which permitted betting.</p>

<p>Then in another place crowds were gathered
around the hulas (the many forms of dancing).
These sports were all in the open air and seemed
to be full of interest.</p>

<p>There was a strange quality which fettered
every new-born ghost: he could only go in the
direction into which he was pushed by the hand
of some stronger power. If the guardian of a
ghost struck it on one side, it would move off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in the direction indicated by the blow or the push
until spirit strength and experience came and he
could go alone. The newcomer desired to join
in these games and started to go, but the sister
slapped him on the breast and drove him away.
These were shadow games into which those who
entered could never go back to the substantial
things of life.</p>

<p>Then there was a large grass house inside which
many ghosts were making merry. The visitor
wanted to join this great company, but the sister
knew that, if he once was engulfed by this crowd
of spirits in this shadow-land, her brother could
never escape. The crowds of players would
seize him like a whirlwind and he would be unable
to know the way he came in or the way out.
Ka-ilio-hae tried to slip away from his sister, but
he could not turn readily. He was still a very
awkward ghost, and his sister slapped him back
in the way in which she wanted him to go.</p>

<p>An island which was supposed to float on the
ocean as one of the homes of the aumakuas (the
ghosts of the ancestors) had the same characteristics.
The ghosts (aumakuas) lived on the shadows
of all that belonged to the earth-life. It was said
that a canoe with a party of young people landed
on this island of dreams and for some time enjoyed
the food and fruits and sports, but after
returning to their homes could not receive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
nourishment of the food of their former lives, and
soon died. The legends taught that no ghost
passing out of the body could return unless it
made the life of the aumakuas tabu to itself.</p>

<p>Soon the sister led her brother to a great field,
stone walled, in which were such fine grass houses
as were built only for chiefs of the highest rank.
There she pointed to a narrow passage-way into
which she told her brother he must enter by
himself.</p>

<p>"This," she said, "is the home of Walia, the
high chief of the ghosts living in this place. You
must go to him. Listen to all he says to you.
Say little. Return quickly. There will be three
watchmen guarding this passage. The first will
ask you, 'What is the fruit [desire] of your heart?'
You will answer, 'Walia.' Then he will let you
enter the passage.</p>

<p>"Inside the walls of the narrow way will be
the second watchman. He will ask why you
come; again answer, 'Walia,' and pass by him.</p>

<p>"At the end of the entrance the third guardian
stands holding a raised spear ready to strike.
Call to him, 'Ka-make-loa' [The Great Death].
This is the name of his spear. Then he will ask
what you want, and you must reply, 'To see the
chief,' and he will let you pass.</p>

<p>"Then again when you stand at the door of
the great house you will see two heads bending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
together in the way so that you cannot enter or
see the king and his queen. If these heads can
catch a spirit coming to see the king without
knowing the proper incantations, they will throw
that ghost into the Po-Milu [The Dark Spirit-world].
Watch therefore and remember all that
is told you.</p>

<p>"When you see these heads, point your hands
straight before you between them and open your
arms, pushing these guards off on each side,
then the ala-nui [the great way] will be open for
you&mdash;and you can enter.</p>

<p>"You will see kahilis [soft long feather fans]
moving over the chiefs. The king will awake and
call, 'Why does this traveller come?' You will
reply quickly, 'He comes to see the Divine One.'
When this is said no injury will come to you.
Listen and remember and you will be alive again."</p>

<p>Ka-ilio-hae did as he was told with the three
watchmen, and each one stepped back, saying,
"Noa" (the tabu is lifted), and he pushed by.
At the door he shoved the two heads to the side
and entered the chief's house to the Ka-ikuwai
(the middle), falling on his hands and knees. The
servants were waving the kahilis this way and
that. There was motion, but no noise.</p>

<p>The chief awoke, looked at Ka-ilio-hae, and
said: "Aloha, stranger, come near. Who is the
high chief of your land?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Ka-ilio-hae gave the name of his king,
and the genealogy from ancient times of the
chiefs dead and in the spirit-world.</p>

<p>The queen of ghosts arose, and the kneeling
spirit saw one more beautiful than any woman
in all the island, and he fell on his face before her.</p>

<p>The king told him to go back and enter his body
and tell his people about troubles near at hand.</p>

<p>While he was before the king twice he heard
messengers call to the people that the sports were
all over; any one not heeding would be thrown
into the darkest place of the home of the ghosts
when the third call had been sounded.</p>

<p>The sister was troubled, for she knew that at
the third call the stone walls around the king's
houses would close and her brother would be held
fast forever in the spirit-land, so she uttered her
incantations and passed the guard. Softly she
called. Her brother reluctantly came. She
seized him and pushed him outside. Then they
heard the third call, and met the multitude of
ghosts coming inland from their sports in the
sea, and other multitudes hastening homeward
from their work and sports on the land.</p>

<p>They met a beautiful young woman who
called to them to come to her home, and pointed
to a point of rock where many birds were resting.
The sister struck her brother and forced
him down to the seaside where she had her home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and her responsibility, for she was one of the
guardians of the entrance to the spirit-world.</p>

<p>She knew well what must be done to restore
the spirit to the body, so she told her brother
they must at once obey the command of the king;
but the brother had seen the delights of the life
of the aumakuas and wanted to stay. He tried
to slip away and hide, but his sister held him fast
and compelled him to go along the beach to his
old home and his waiting body.</p>

<p>When they came to the place where the body
lay she found a hole in the corner of the house
and pushed the spirit through. When he saw
the body he was very much afraid and tried to
escape, but the sister caught him and pushed
him inside the foot up to the knee. He did not
like the smell of the body and tried to rush back,
but she pushed him inside again and held the
foot fast and shook him and made him go to the
head.</p>

<p>The family heard a little sound in the mouth
and saw breath moving the breast, then they
knew that he was alive again. They warmed
the body and gave a little food. When strength
returned he told his family all about his wonderful
journey into the land of ghosts.</p>

<p class="center">KALAI-PAHOA, THE POISON-GOD</p>


<p>The Bishop Museum of Honolulu has one of
the best as well as one of the most scientifically
arranged collections of Hawaiian curios in
the world. In it are images of many of the gods
of long ago. One of these is a helmeted head
made of wicker-work, over which has been woven
a thick covering of beautiful red feathers
bordered with yellow feathers. This was the
mighty war-god of the great Kamehameha.
Another is a squat rough image, crudely carved
out of wood. This was Kamehameha's poison-god.</p>

<p>The ancient Hawaiians were acquainted with
poisons of various kinds. They understood the
medicinal qualities of plants and found some of
these strong enough to cause sickness and even
death. One of the Hawaiian writers said: "The
opihi-awa is a poison shell-fish. These are bitter
and deadly and can be used in putting enemies
to death. Kalai-pahoa is also a tree in which
there is the power to kill."</p>

<p>Kamehameha's poison-god was called Kalai-pahoa,
because it was cut from that tree which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
grew in the upland forest on the island of
Molokai.</p>

<p>A native writer says there was an antidote for
the poison from Kalai-pahoa, and he thus describes
it: "The war-god and the poison-god were
not left standing in the temples like the images
of other gods, but after being worshipped were
wrapped in kapa and laid away.</p>

<p>"When the priest wanted Kalai-pahoa he was
taken down and anointed with cocoanut-oil and
wrapped in a fresh kapa cloth. Then he was
set up above the altar and a feast prepared
before him, awa to drink, and pig, fish, and poi
to eat.</p>

<p>"Then the priest who had special care of this
god would scrape off a little from the wood, and
put it in an awa cup, and hold the cup before the
god, chanting a prayer for the life of the king, the
government, and the people. One of the priests
would then take the awa cup, drink the contents,
and quickly take food.</p>

<p>"Those who were watching would presently see
a red flush creep over his cheeks, growing stronger
and stronger, while the eyes would become glassy
and the breath short like that of a dying man.
Then the priest would touch his lips to the stick,
Mai-ola, and have his life restored. Mai-ola
was a god who had another tree. When Kalai-pahoa
entered his tree on Molokai, Mai-ola<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
entered another tree and became the enemy of
the poison-god."</p>

<p>The priests of the poison-god were very powerful
in the curious rite called pule-ana-ana, or
praying to death. The Hawaiians said: "Perhaps
the priests of Kalai-pahoa put poison in
bananas or in taro. It was believed that they
scraped the body of the image and put the pieces
in the food of the one they wished to pray to
death. There was one chief who was very skilful
in waving kahilis, or feather fans, over any one
and shaking the powder of death into the food
from the moving feathers. Another would have
scrapings in his cloak and would drop them into
whatever food his enemy was eating." The
spirit of death was supposed to reside in the wood
of the poison-god.</p>

<p>A very interesting legend was told by the old
people to their children to explain the coming
of medicinal and poisonous properties into the
various kinds of trees and plants. These stories
all go back to the time when Milu died and became
the king of ghosts. They say that after
the death of Milu the gods left Waipio Valley on
the island of Hawaii and crossed the channel to
the island Maui.</p>

<p>These gods had all kinds of power for evil, such
as stopping the breath, chilling or burning the
body, making headaches or pains in the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
or causing palsy or lameness or other injuries,
even inflicting death.</p>

<p>Pua and Kapo, who from ancient times have
been worshipped as goddesses having medicinal
power, joined the party when they came to Maui.
Then all the gods went up Mauna Loa, a place
where there was a large and magnificent forest
with fine trees, graceful vines and ferns, and
beautiful flowers. They all loved this place,
therefore they became gods of the forest.</p>

<p>Near this forest lived Kane-ia-kama, a high
chief, who was a very great gambler. He had
gambled away all his possessions. While he was
sleeping, the night of his final losses, he heard
some one call, "O Kane-ia-kama, begin your
play again." He shouted out into the darkness:
"I have bet everything. I have nothing left."</p>

<p>Then the voice again said, "Bet your bones,
bet your bones, and see what will happen."</p>

<p>When he went to the gambling-place the next
day the people all laughed at him, for they knew
his goods were all gone. He sat down among
them, however, and said: "I truly have nothing
left. My treasures are all gone; but I have my
bones. If you wish, I will bet my body, then I
will play with you."</p>

<p>The other chiefs scornfully placed some property
on one side and said, "That will be of the
same value as your bones."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>They gambled and he won. The chiefs were
angry at their loss and bet again and again. He
always won until he had more wealth than any
one on the island.</p>

<p>After the gambling days were over he heard
again the same voice saying: "O Kane-ia-kama,
you have done all that I told you and have become
very rich in property and servants. Will you
obey once more?"</p>

<p>The chief gratefully thanked the god for the
aid that he had received, and said he would obey.
The voice then said: "Perhaps we can help you
to one thing. You are now wealthy, but there is
a last gift for you. You must listen carefully
and note all I show you."</p>

<p>Then this god of the night pointed out the
trees into which the gods had entered when they
decided to remain for a time in the forest, and
explained to him all their different characteristics.
He showed him where gods and goddesses
dwelt and gave their names. Then he ordered
Kane-ia-kama to take offerings of pigs, fish, cocoanuts,
bananas, chickens, kapas, and all other
things used for sacrifice, and place them at the
roots of these trees into which the gods had
entered, the proper offerings for each.</p>

<p>The next morning he went into the forest and
saw that he had received a very careful description
of each tree. He observed carefully the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
shown as the home of the spirit who had become
his strange helper.</p>

<p>Before night fell he placed offerings as commanded.
As a worshipper he took each one of
these trees for his god, so he had many gods of
plants and trees.</p>

<p>For some reason not mentioned in the legends
he sent woodcutters to cut down these trees, or
at least to cut gods out of them with their stone
axes.</p>

<p>They began to cut. The koko (blood) of the
trees, as the natives termed the flowing sap,
and the chips flying out struck some of the
woodcutters and they fell dead.</p>

<p>Kane-ia-kama made cloaks of the long leaves
of the ieie vine and tied them around his men,
so that their bodies could not be touched, then
the work was easily accomplished.</p>

<p>The chief kept these images of gods cut from
the medicinal trees and could use them as he
desired. The most powerful of all these gods was
that one whose voice he had heard in the night.
To this god he gave the name
Kalai-pahoa (The-one-cut-by-the-pahoa-or-stone-axe).</p>

<p>One account relates that the pahoa (stone)
from which the axe was made came from Kalakoi,
a celebrated place for finding a very hard lava of
fine grain, the very best for making stone
implements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The god who had spoken to the chief in his
dream was sometimes called Kane-kulana-ula
(noted red Kane).</p>

<p>The gods were caught by the sacrifices of the
chief while they were in their tree bodies before
they could change back into their spirit bodies,
therefore their power was supposed to remain in
the trees.</p>

<p>It was said that when Kane-kulana-ula changed
into his tree form he leaped into it with a tremendous
flash of lightning, thus the great mana,
or miraculous power, went into that tree.</p>

<p>The strange death which came from the god
Kalai-pahoa made that god and his priest greatly
feared. One of the pieces of this tree fell into
a spring at Kaakee near the maika, or disc-rolling
field, on Molokai. All the people who drank
at that spring died. They filled it up and the
chiefs ruled that the people should not keep
branches or pieces of the tree for the injury of
others. If such pieces were found in the possession
of any one he should die. Only the carved
gods were to be preserved.</p>

<p>Kahekili, king of Maui at the time of the
accession of Kamehameha to the sovereignty of
the island Hawaii, had these images in his possession
as a part of his household gods.</p>

<p>Kamehameha sent a prophet to ask him for
one of these gods. Kahekili refused to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
one, but told him to wait and he should have
the poison-god and the government over all the
islands.</p>

<p>One account records that a small part from
the poison one was then given.</p>

<p>So, after the death of Kahekili, Kamehameha
did conquer all the islands with their hosts of
gods, and Kalai-pahoa, the poison-god, came
into his possession.</p>

<p>The overthrow of idolatry and the destruction
of the system of tabus came in 1819, when most
of the wooden gods were burned or thrown into
ponds and rivers, but a few were concealed by
their caretakers. Among these were the two
gods now to be seen in the Bishop Museum in
Honolulu.</p>

<p class="center">KE-AO-MELE-MELE, THE MAID OF
THE GOLDEN CLOUD</p>


<p>The Hawaiians never found gold in their
islands. The mountains being of recent
volcanic origin do not show traces of the precious
metals; but hovering over the mountain-tops
clustered the glorious golden clouds built up by
damp winds from the seas. The Maiden of the
Golden Cloud belonged to the cloud mountains
and was named after their golden glow.</p>

<p>Her name in the Hawaiian tongue was Ke-ao-mele-mele
(The Golden Cloud). She was said
to be one of the first persons brought by the gods
to find a home in the Paradise of the Pacific.</p>

<p>In the ancient times, the ancestors of the
Hawaiians came from far-off ocean lands, for
which they had different names, such as The
Shining Heaven, The Floating Land of Kane,
The Far-off White Land of Kahiki, and Kuai-he-lani
(purchased is heaven). It was from
Kuai-he-lani that the Maiden of the Golden
Cloud was called to live in Hawaii.</p>

<p>In this legendary land lived Mo-o-inanea
(self-reliant dragon). She cared for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
children of the gods, one of whom was named
Hina, later known in Polynesian mythology as
Moon Goddess.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea took her to Ku, one of the gods.
They lived together many years and a family of
children came to them.</p>

<p>Two of the great gods of Polynesia, Kane and
Kanaloa, had found a beautiful place above
Honolulu on Oahu, one of the Hawaiian Islands.
Here they determined to build a home for the
first-born child of Hina.</p>

<p>Thousands of eepa (gnome) people lived
around this place, which was called Waolani.
The gods had them build a temple which was
also called Waolani (divine forest).</p>

<p>When the time came for the birth of the child,
clouds and fogs crept over the land, thunder
rolled and lightning flashed, red torrents poured
down the hillsides, strong winds hurled the rain
through bending trees, earthquakes shook the
land, huge waves rolled inland from the sea.
Then a beautiful boy was born. All these signs
taken together signified the birth of a chief of
the highest degree&mdash;even of the family of the
gods.</p>

<p>Kane and Kanaloa sent their sister Anuenue
(rainbow) to get the child of Ku and Hina that
they might care for it. All three should be the
caretakers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Anuenue went first to the place where
Mo-o-inanea dwelt, to ask her if it would be
right. Mo-o-inanea said she might go, but if
they brought up that child he must not have a
wife from any of the women of Hawaii-nui-akea
(great wide Hawaii).</p>

<p>Anuenue asked, "Suppose I get that child;
who is to give it the proper name?"</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea said: "You bring the child to our
brothers and they will name this child. They
have sent you, and the responsibility of the name
rests on them."</p>

<p>Anuenue said good-by, and in the twinkling
of an eye stood at the door of the house where
Ku dwelt.</p>

<p>Ku looked outside and saw the bright glow of
the rainbow, but no cloud or rain, so he called
Hina. "Here is a strange thing. You must
come and look at it. There is no rain and there
are no clouds or mist, but there is a rainbow at
our door."</p>

<p>They went out, but Anuenue had changed her
rainbow body and stood before them as a very
beautiful woman, wrapped only in the colors of
the rainbow.</p>

<p>Ku and Hina began to shiver with a nameless
terror as they looked at this strange maiden.
They faltered out a welcome, asking her to enter
their house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>As she came near to them Ku said, "From
what place do you come?"</p>

<p>Anuenue said: "I am from the sky, a messenger
sent by my brothers to get your child
that they may bring it up. When grown, if the
child wants its parents, we will bring it back.
If it loves us it shall stay with us."</p>

<p>Hina bowed her head and Ku wailed, both
thinking seriously for a little while. Then Ku
said: "If Mo-o-inanea has sent you she shall
have the child. You may take this word to
her."</p>

<p>Anuenue replied: "I have just come from her
and the word I brought you is her word. If I
go away I shall not come again."</p>

<p>Hina said to Ku: "We must give this child
according to her word. It is not right to disobey
Mo-o-inanea."</p>

<p>Anuenue took the child and studied the omens
for its future, then she said, "This child is of the
very highest, the flower on the top of the tree."</p>

<p>She prepared to take the child away, and bade
the parents farewell. She changed her body into
the old rainbow colors shining out of a mist, then
she wrapped the child in the rainbow, bearing it
away.</p>

<p>Ku and Hina went out looking up and watching
the cloud of rainbow colors floating in the
sky. Strong, easy winds blew and carried this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
cloud out over the ocean. The navel-string had
not been cut off, so Anuenue broke off part and
threw it into the ocean, where it became the
Hee-makoko, a blood-red squid. This is the
legendary origin of that kind of squid.</p>

<p>Anuenue passed over many islands, coming at
last to Waolani to the temple built by the
gnomes under Kane and Kanaloa. They consecrated
the child, and cut off another part of
the navel-cord. Kanaloa took it to the Nuuanu
pali back of Honolulu, to the place called Ka-ipu-o-Lono.
Kane and Kanaloa consulted about
servants to live with the boy, and decided that
they must have only ugly ones, who would not
be desired as wives by their boy. Therefore
they gathered together the lame, crooked, deformed,
and blind among the gnome people.
There were hundreds of these living in different
homes, and performing different tasks. Anuenue
was the ruler over all of them. This child was
named Kahanai-a-ke-Akua (the one adopted
by the gods). He was given a very high tabu
by Kane and Kanaloa. No one was allowed to
stand before him and no person's shadow could
fall upon him.</p>

<p>Hina again conceived. The signs of this child
appeared in the heavens and were seen on Oahu.
Kane wanted to send Lanihuli and Waipuhia,
their daughters, living near the pali of Waolani
and Nuuanu. The girls asked where they should
go.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">

<span class="caption">THE MISTY PALI, NUUANU</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>Kane said: "We send you to the land Kuai-he-lani,
a land far distant from Hawaii, to get the
child of Hina. If the parents ask you about
your journey, tell them you have come for the
child. Tell our names and refer to Mo-o-inanea.
You must now look at the way by which to go
to Kuai-he-lani.</p>

<p>They looked and saw a great bird&mdash;Iwa. They
got on this bird and were carried far up in the
heavens. By and by the bird called two or three
times. The girls were frightened and looking
down saw the bright shining land Kuai-he-lani
below them. The bird took them to the door of
Ku's dwelling-place.</p>

<p>Ku and Hina were caring for a beautiful girl-baby.
They looked up and saw two fine women
at their door. They invited them in and asked
whence they came and why they travelled.</p>

<p>The girls told them they were sent by the gods
Kane and Kanaloa. Suddenly a new voice was
heard. Mo-o-inanea was by the house. She
called to Ku and to Hina, telling them to give
the child into the hands of the strangers, that
they might take her to Waka, a great priestess,
to be brought up by her in the ohia forests of
the island of Hawaii. She named that girl Paliula,
and explained to the parents that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Paliula should grow up, to be married, the boy
of Waolani should be her husband. The girls
then took the babe. They were all carried by
the bird, Iwa, far away in the sky to Waolani,
where they told Kane and Kanaloa the message
or prophecy of Mo-o-inanea.</p>

<p>The gods sent Iwa with the child to Waka, on
Hawaii, to her dwelling-place in the districts
of Hilo and Puna where she was caring for all
kinds of birds in the branches of the trees and
among the flowers.</p>

<p>Waka commanded the birds to build a house
for Paliula. This was quickly done. She commanded
the bird Iwa to go to Nuumea-lani, a
far-off land above Kuai-he-lani, the place where
Mo-o-inanea was now living.</p>

<p>It was said that Waka, by her magic power,
saw in that land two trees, well cared for by
multitudes of servants; the name of one was
"Makalei." This was a tree for fish. All
kinds of fish would go to it. The second was
"Kalala-ika-wai." This was the tree used for
getting all kinds of food. Call this tree and
food would appear.</p>

<p>Waka wanted Mo-o-inanea to send these trees
to Hawaii.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea gave these trees to Iwa, who
brought them to Hawaii and gave them to Waka.
Waka rejoiced and took care of them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
bird went back to Waolani, telling Kane and
Kanaloa all the journey from first to last.</p>

<p>The gods gave the girls resting-places in the
fruitful lands under the shadow of the beautiful
Nuuanu precipices.</p>

<p>Waka watched over Paliula until she grew
up, beautiful like the moon of Mahea-lani
(full moon).</p>

<p>The fish tree, Makalei, which made the fish
of all that region tame, was planted by the side
of running water, in very restful places spreading
all along the river-sides to the seashore. Fish
came to every stream where the trees grew, and
filled the waters.</p>

<p>The other tree was planted and brought prepared
food for Paliula. The hidden land
where this place was has always been called
Paliula, a beautiful green spot&mdash;a home for
fruits and flowers and birds in a forest wilderness.</p>

<p>When Paliula had grown up, Waka went to
Waolani to meet Kane, Kanaloa, and Anuenue.
There she saw Kahanai-a-ke-Akua (the boy
brought up by the gods) and desired him for
Paliula's husband. There was no man so
splendid and no woman so beautiful as these
two. The caretakers decided that they must
be husband and wife.</p>

<p>Waka returned to the island Hawaii to prepare
for the coming of the people from Waolani.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Waka built new houses finer and better than
the first, and covered them with the yellow
feathers of the Mamo bird with the colors of the
rainbow resting over. Anuenue had sent some
of her own garments of rainbows.</p>

<p>Then Waka went again to Waolani to talk
with Kane and Kanaloa and their sister Anuenue.</p>

<p>They said to her: "You return, and Anuenue
will take Kahanai and follow. When the night
of their arrival comes, lightning will play over
all the mountains above Waolani and through
the atmosphere all around the temple, even to
Hawaii. After a while, around your home the
leaves of the trees will dance and sing and the
ohia-trees themselves bend back and forth shaking
their beautiful blossoms. Then you may
know that the Rainbow Maiden and the boy
are by your home on the island of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Waka returned to her home in the tangled
forest above Hilo. There she met her adopted
daughter and told her about the coming of her
husband.</p>

<p>Soon the night of rolling thunder and flashing
lightning came. The people of all the region
around Hilo were filled with fear. Kane-hekili
(flashing lightning) was a miraculous body
which Kane had assumed. He had gone before
the boy and the rainbow, flashing his way through
the heavens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The gods had commanded Kane-hekili to
dwell in the heavens in all places wherever the
gods desired him to be, so that he could go
wherever commanded. He always obeyed without
questioning.</p>

<p>The thunder and lightning played over ocean
and land while the sun was setting beyond the
islands in the west.</p>

<p>After a time the trees bent over, the leaves
danced and chanted their songs. The flowers
made a glorious halo as they swayed back and
forth in their dances.</p>

<p>Kane told the Rainbow Maiden to take their
adopted child to Hawaii-nui-akea.</p>

<p>When she was ready, she heard her brothers
calling the names of trees which were to go with
her on her journey. Some of the legends say
that Laka, the hula-god, was dancing before the
two. The tree people stood before the Rainbow
Maiden and the boy, ready to dance all the way
to Hawaii. The tree people are always restless
and in ceaseless motion. The gods told them
to sing together and dance. Two of the tree
people were women, Ohia and Lamakea.
Lamakea is a native whitewood tree. There
are large trees at Waialae in the mountains of
the island Oahu. Ohia is a tree always full of
fringed red blossoms. They were very beautiful
in their wind bodies. They were kupuas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
or wizards, and could be moving trees or dancing
women as they chose.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Maiden took the boy in her
arms up into the sky, and with the tree people
went on her journey. She crossed over the
islands to the mountains of the island Hawaii,
then went down to find Paliula.</p>

<p>She placed the tree people around the house
to dance and sing with soft rustling noises.</p>

<p>Waka heard the chants of the tree people and
opened the door of the glorious house, calling for
Kahanai to come in. When Paliula saw
him, her heart fluttered with trembling delight,
for she knew this splendid youth was the husband
selected by Waka, the prophetess. Waka called
the two trees belonging to Paliula to bring
plenty of fish and food.</p>

<p>Then Waka and Anuenue left their adopted
children in the wonderful yellow feather house.</p>

<p>The two young people, when left together,
talked about their birthplaces and their parents.
Paliula first asked Kahanai about his land and
his father and mother. He told her that he was
they child of Ku and Hina from Kuai-he-lani,
brought up by Kane and the other gods at
Waolani.</p>

<p>The girl went out and asked Waka about her
parents, and learned that this was her first-born
brother, who was to be her husband because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they had very high divine blood. Their descendants
would be the chiefs of the people. This
marriage was a command from parents and
ancestors and Mo-o-inanea.</p>

<p>She went into the house, telling the brother
who she was, and the wish of the gods.</p>

<p>After ten days they were married and lived
together a long time.</p>

<p>At last, Kahanai desired to travel all around
Hawaii. In this journey he met Poliahu, the
white-mantle girl of Mauna Kea, the snow-covered
mountain of the island Hawaii.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Kuai-he-lani, Ku and Hina
were living together. One day Mo-o-inanea
called to Hina, telling her that she would be the
mother of a more beautiful and wonderful child
than her other two children. This child should
live in the highest places of the heavens and
should have a multitude of bodies which could
be seen at night as well as in the day.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea went away to Nuumea-lani and
built a very wonderful house in Ke-alohi-lani
(shining land), a house always turning around
by day and by night like the ever moving clouds;
indeed, it was built of all kinds of clouds and
covered with fogs. There she made a spring
of flowing water and put it outside for the coming
child to have as a bath. There she planted the
seeds of magic flowers, Kanikawi and Kanikawa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
legendary plants of old Hawaii. Then she
went to Kuai-he-lani and found Ku and Hina
asleep. She took a child out of the top of the
head of Hina and carried it away to the new
home, naming it Ke-ao-mele-mele (the yellow
cloud), the Maiden of the Golden Cloud, a wonderfully
beautiful girl.</p>

<p>No one with a human body was permitted to
come to this land of Nuumea-lani. No kupuas
were allowed to make trouble for the child.</p>

<p>The ao-opua (narrow-pointed clouds) were
appointed watchmen serving Ke-ao-mele-mele,
the Maiden of the Golden Cloud.</p>

<p>All the other clouds were servants: the ao-opua-ka-kohiaka
(morning clouds), ao-opua-ahiahi
(evening clouds), ao-opua-aumoe (night
clouds), ao-opua-kiei (peeking clouds), ao-opua-aha-lo
(down-looking clouds), ao-opua-ku (image-shaped
clouds rising at top of sea), opua-hele
(morning-flower clouds), opua-noho-mai (resting
clouds), opua-mele-mele (gold-colored clouds),
opua-lani (clouds high up), ka-pae-opua (at
surface of sea or clouds along the horizon), ka-lani-opua
(clouds up above horizon), ka-ma-kao-ka-lani
(clouds in the eye of the sun), ka-wele-lau-opua
(clouds highest in the sky).</p>

<p>All these clouds were caretakers watching for
the welfare of that girl. Mo-o-inanea gave them
their laws for service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>She took Ku-ke-ao-loa (the long cloud of Ku)
and put him at the door of the house of clouds,
with great magic power. He was to be the
messenger to all the cloud-lands of the parents
and ancestors of this girl.</p>

<p>"The Eye of the Sun" was the cloud with
magic power to see all things passing underneath
near or far.</p>

<p>Then there was the opua-alii, cloud-chief with
the name Ka-ao-opua-ola (the sharp-pointed
living cloud). This was the sorcerer and astronomer,
never weary, never tired, knowing
and watching over all things.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea gave her mana-nui, or great magic
power, to Ke-ao-mele-mele&mdash;with divine tabus.
She made this child the heir of all the divine
islands, therefore she was able to know what
was being done everywhere. She understood
how the Kahanai had forsaken his sister to live
with Poliahu. So she went to Hawaii to aid
her sister Paliula.</p>

<p>When Mo-o-inanea had taken the child from
the head of Hina, Ku and Hina were aroused.
Ku went out and saw wonderful cloud images
standing near the house, like men. Ku and
Hina watched these clouds shining and changing
colors in the light of the dawn, as the sun appeared.
The light of the sun streamed over
the skies. For three days these changing clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
were around them. Then in the midst of these
clouds appeared a strange land of the skies surrounded
by the ao-opua (the narrow-pointed
clouds). In the night of the full moon, the aka
(ghost) shadow of that land leaped up into the
moon and became fixed there. This was the
Alii-wahine-o-ka-malu (the queen of shadows),
dwelling in the moon.</p>

<p>Ku and Hina did not understand the meaning
of these signs or shadows, so they went back into
the house, falling into deep sleep.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea spoke to Hina in her dreams, saying
that these clouds were signs of her daughter
born from the head&mdash;a girl having great knowledge
and miraculous power in sorcery, who
would take care of them in their last days. They
must learn all the customs of kilo-kilo, or sorcery.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea again sent Ku-ke-ao-loa to the
house of Ku, that cloud appearing as a man at
their door.</p>

<p>They asked who he was. He replied: "I
am a messenger sent to teach you the sorcery or
witcheries of cloud-land. You must have this
knowledge that you may know your cloud-daughter.
Let us begin our work at this time."</p>

<p>They all went outside the house and sat down
on a stone at the side of the door.</p>

<p>Ku-ke-ao-loa looked up and called Mo-o-inanea
by name. His voice went to Ke-alohi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>lani,
and Mo-o-inanea called for all the clouds
to come with their ruler Ke-ao-mele-mele.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Arise, O yellow cloud,<br />
&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, O cloud&mdash;the eye of the sun,<br />
&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, O beautiful daughters of the skies,<br />
&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;Shine in the eyes of the sun, arise!"<br />
</p>

<p>Ke-ao-mele-mele arose and put on her glorious
white kapas like the snow on Mauna Kea. At
this time the cloud watchmen over Kuai-he-lani
were revealing their cloud forms to Hina and Ku.
The Long Cloud told Hina and Ku to look
sharply into the sky to see the meaning of all the
cloud forms which were servants of the divine
chiefess, their habits of meeting, moving, separating,
their forms, their number, the stars appearing
through them, the fixed stars and moving
clouds, the moving stars and moving clouds, the
course of the winds among the different clouds.</p>

<p>When he had taught Ku and Hina the sorcery
of cloud-land, he disappeared and returned to
Ke-alohi-lani.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, Ku went out to the side
of their land. He saw a cloud of very beautiful
form, appearing like a woman. This was resting
in the sky above his head. Hina woke up,
missed Ku, looked out and saw Ku sitting on
the beach watching the clouds above him. She
went to him and by her power told him that
he had the desire to travel and that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
go on his journey and find the woman of his
vision.</p>

<p>A beautiful chiefess, Hiilei, was at that time
living in one of the large islands of the heavens.
Ku and Hina went to this place. Ku married
Hiilei, and Hina found a chief named Olopana
and married him. Ku and Hiilei had a redskin
child, a boy, whom they named Kau-mai-liula
(twilight resting in the sky). This child
was taken by Mo-o-inanea to Ke-alohi-lani to
live with Ke-ao-mele-mele. Olopana and Hina
had a daughter whom they called Kau-lana-iki-pokii
(beautiful daughter of sunset), who was
taken by Ku and Hiilei.</p>

<p>Hina then called to the messenger cloud to
come and carry a request to Mo-o-inanea that
Kau-mai-liula be given to her and Olopana.
This was done. So they were all separated from
each other, but in the end the children were
taken to Hawaii.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paliula was living above Hilo
with her husband Kahanai-a-ke-Akua (adopted
son of the gods). Kahanai became restless and
determined to see other parts of the land, so he
started on a journey around the islands. He soon
met a fine young man Waiola (water of life).</p>

<p>Waiola had never seen any one so glorious in
appearance as the child of the gods, so he fell
down before him, saying: "I have never seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
any one so divine as you. You must have come
from the skies. I will belong to you through
the coming years."</p>

<p>The chief said, "I take you as my aikane
[bosom friend] to the last days."</p>

<p>They went down to Waiakea, a village by Hilo,
and met a number of girls covered with wreaths
of flowers and leaves. Kahanai sent Waiola
to sport with them. He himself was of too
high rank. One girl told her brother Kanuku
to urge the chief to come down, and sent him
leis. He said he could not receive their gift,
but must wear his own lei. He called for his
divine caretaker to send his garlands, and immediately
the most beautiful rainbows wrapped
themselves around his neck and shoulders, falling
down around his body.</p>

<p>Then he came down to Waiakea. The chief
took Kanuku also as a follower and went on
up the coast to Hamakua.</p>

<p>The chief looked up Mauna Kea and there
saw the mountain women, who lived in the white
land above the trees. Poliahu stood above the
precipices in her kupua-ano (wizard character),
revealing herself as a very beautiful woman
wearing a white mantle.</p>

<p>When the chief and his friends came near the
cold place where she was sitting, she invited
them to her home, inland and mountainward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The chief asked his friends to go with him to the
mountain house of the beauty of Mauna Kea.</p>

<p>They were well entertained. Poliahu called
her sisters, Lilinoe and Ka-lau-a-kolea, beautiful
girls, and gave them sweet-sounding shells to
blow. All through the night they made music
and chanted the stirring songs of the grand
mountains. The chief delighted in Poliahu and
lived many months on the mountain.</p>

<p>One morning Paliula in her home above Hilo
awoke from a dream in which she saw Poliahu
and the chief living together, so she told Waka,
asking if the dream were true. Waka, by her
magic power, looked over the island and saw
the three young men living with the three
maidens of the snow mantle. She called with a
penetrating voice for the chief to return to his
own home. She went in the form of a great
bird and brought him back.</p>

<p>But Poliahu followed, met the chief secretly
and took him up to Mauna Kea again, covering
the mountain with snow so that Waka could
not go to find them.</p>

<p>Waka and the bird friends of Paliula could
not reach the mountain-top because of the cold.
Waka went to Waolani and told Anuenue about
Paliula's trouble.</p>

<p>Anuenue was afraid that Kane and Kanaloa
might hear that the chief had forsaken his sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and was much troubled, so she asked Waka to
go with her to see Mo-o-inanea at Ke-alohi-lani,
but the gods Kane and Kanaloa could not
be deceived. They understood that there was
trouble, and came to meet them.</p>

<p>Kane told Waka to return and tell the girl to
be patient; the chief should be punished for
deserting her.</p>

<p>Waka returned and found that Paliula had
gone away wandering in the forest, picking lehua
flowers on the way up toward the Lua Pele, the
volcano pit of Pele, the goddess of fire. There
she had found a beautiful girl and took her as
an aikane (friend) to journey around Hawaii.
They travelled by way of the districts of Puna,
Kau, and Kona to Waipio, where she saw a fine-looking
man standing above a precipice over
which leaped the wonderful mist-falls of Hiilawe.
This young chief married the beautiful girl
friend of Paliula.</p>

<p>Poliahu by her kupua power recognized
Paliula, and told the chief that she saw her with
a new husband.</p>

<p>Paliula went on to her old home and rested
many days. Waka then took her from island to
island until they were near Oahu. When they
came to the beach, Paliula leaped ashore and
went up to Manoa Valley. There she rushed
into the forest and climbed the ridges and preci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>pices.
She wandered through the rough places,
her clothes torn and ragged.</p>

<p>Kane and Kanaloa saw her sitting on the
mountain-side. Kane sent servants to find her
and bring her to live with them at Waolani.
When she came to the home of the gods in
Nuuanu Valley she thought longingly of her
husband and sang this mele:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Lo, at Waolani is my lei of the blood-red rain,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The lei of the misty rain gathered and put together,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Put together in my thought with tears.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Spoiled is the body by love,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Dear in the eyes of the lover.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My brother, the first-born,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Return, oh, return, my brother."<br />
</p>

<p>Paliula, chanting this, turned away from Waolani
to Waianae and dwelt for a time with the
chiefess Kalena.</p>

<p>While Paliula was living with the people of
the cold winds of Waianae she wore leis of
mokihana berries and fragrant grass, and was
greatly loved by the family. She went up the
mountain to a great gulch. She lay down to
sleep, but heard a sweet voice saying, "You
cannot sleep on the edge of that gulch." She
was frequently awakened by that voice. She
went on up the mountain-ridges above Waianae.
At night when she rested she heard the voices
again and again. This was the voice of Hii-lani-wai,
who was teaching the hula dance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
girls of Waianae. Paliula wanted to see the
one who had such a sweet voice, so went along
the pali and came to a hula house, but the house
was closed tight and she could not look in.</p>

<p>She sat down outside. Soon Hii-lani-wai
opened the door and saw Paliula and asked her
to come in. It was the first time Paliula had
seen this kind of dancing. Her delight in the
dance took control of her mind, and she forgot
her husband and took Hii-lani-wai as her aikane,
dwelling with her for a time.</p>

<p>One day they went out into the forest. Kane
had sent the dancing trees from Waolani to
meet them. While in the forest they heard the
trees singing and dancing like human beings.
Hii-lani-wai called this a very wonderful thing.
Paliula told her that she had seen the trees do
this before. The trees made her glad.</p>

<p>They went down to the seaside and visited
some days. Paliula desired a boat to go to
the island of Kauai. The people told them of
the dangerous waters, but the girls were stubborn,
so they were given a very small boat.
Hii-lani-wai was steering, and Paliula was paddling
and bailing out the water. The anger of
the seas did not arise. On the way Paliula fell
asleep, but the boat swiftly crossed the channel.
Their boat was covered with all the colors of
the rainbow. Some women on land at last saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
them and beckoned with their hands for them
to come ashore.</p>

<p>Malu-aka (shadow of peace) was the most
beautiful of all the women on Kauai. She was
kind and hospitable and took them to her house.
The people came to see these wonderful strangers.
Paliula told Malu-aka her story. She rested,
with the Kauai girls, then went with Malu-aka
over the island and learned the dances of Kauai,
becoming noted throughout the island for her
wonderful grace and skill, dancing like the wind,
feet not touching the ground. Her songs and
the sound of the whirling dance were lifted by
the winds and carried into the dreams of Ke-ao-mele-mele.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ke-ao-mele-mele was living with
her cloud-watchmen and Mo-o-inanea at Ke-alohi-lani.
She began to have dreams, hearing a
sweet voice singing and seeing a glorious woman
dancing, while winds were whispering in the
forests. For five nights she heard the song and
the sound of the dance. Then she told Mo-o-inanea,
who explained her dream, saying: "That
is the voice of Paliula, your sister, who is dancing
and singing near the steep places of Kauai.
Her brother-husband has forsaken her and she
has had much trouble. He is living with Poliahu
on Hawaii."</p>

<p>When Ke-ao-mele-mele heard this, she thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
she would go and live with her sister. Mo-o-inanea
approved of the thought and gave her all
kinds of kupua power. She told her to go and
see the god Kane, who would tell her what to do.</p>

<p>At last she started on her journey with her
watching clouds. She went to see Hina and
Olopana, and Ku and Hiilei. She saw Kau-mai-liula
(twilight resting in the sky), who was
very beautiful, like the fair red flowers of the
ohia in the shadows of the leaves of the tree.
She determined to come back and marry him
after her journey to Oahu.</p>

<p>When she left Kuai-he-lani with her followers
she flew like a bird over the waves of the sea.
Soon she passed Niihau and came to Kauai to
the place where Paliula was dancing, and as
a cloud with her cloud friends spied out the land.
The soft mists of her native land were scattered
over the people by these clouds above them.
Paliula was reminded of her birth-land and
the loved people of her home.</p>

<p>Ke-ao-mele-mele saw the beauty of the dance
and understood the love expressed in the chant.
She flew away from Kauai, crossed the channel,
came to Waolani, met Kane and Kanaloa and
told them she had come to learn from them what
was the right thing to do for the sister and the
husband who had deserted her. Kane suggested
a visit to Hawaii to see Paliula and the chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
so she flew over the islands to Hawaii. Then
she went up the mountain with the ao-pii-kai
(a cloud rising from the sea and climbing the
mountain) until she saw Poliahu and her beautiful
sisters.</p>

<p>Poliahu looked down the mountain-side and
saw a woman coming, but she looked again and
the woman had disappeared. In a little while
a golden cloud rested on the summit of the
mountain. It was the maid in her cloud body
watching her brother and the girl of the white
mountains. For more than twenty days she
remained in that place. Then she returned to
Waolani on Oahu.</p>

<p>Ke-ao-mele-mele determined to learn the
hulas and the accompanying songs. Kane told
her she ought to learn these things. There was
a fine field for dancing at the foot of the mountain
near Waolani, and Kane had planted a
large kukui-tree by its side to give it shade.</p>

<p>Kane and his sister Anuenue went to this field
and sat down in their place. The daughters of
Nuuanu Pali were there. Kane sent Ke-ao-mele-mele
after the dancing-goddess, Kapo,
who lived at Mauna Loa. She was the sister
of the poison-gods and knew the art of sorcery.
Ke-ao-mele-mele took gifts, went to Kapo, made
offerings, and thus for the first time secured a
goddess for the hula.</p>

<span class="caption">DANCING THE HULA</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p><p>Kapo taught Ke-ao-mele-mele the chants and
the movements of the different hulas until she
was very skilful. She flew over the seas to Oahu
and showed the gods her skill. Then, she went
to Kauai, danced on the surf and in the clouds
and above the forests and in the whirlwinds.
Each night she went to one of the other islands,
danced in the skies and over the waters, and
returned home. At last she went to Hawaii
to Mauna Kea, where she saw Kahanai, her
brother. She persuaded him to leave the maiden
of the snow mantle and return to Waolani.
Paliula and her friends had returned to the
home with Waka, where she taught the leaves
of clinging vines and the flowers and leaves on
the tender swinging branches of the forest trees
new motions in their dances with the many
kinds of winds.</p>

<p>One day Kahanai saw signs among the stars
and in the clouds which made him anxious to
travel, so he asked Kane for a canoe. Kane
called the eepa and the menehune people and
told them to make canoes to carry Kahanai to
his parents.</p>

<p>These boats were made in the forests of Waolani.
When the menehunes finished their boat
they carried it down Nuuanu Valley to Puunui.
There they rested and many of the little folk
came to help, taking the canoe down, step by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
step, to the mouth of the Nuuanu stream, where
they had the aid of the river to the ocean.</p>

<p>The menehunes left the boat floating in the
water and went back to Waolani. Of the fairy
people it was said: "No task is difficult. It is
the work of one hand."</p>

<p>On the way down Nuuanu Valley the menehunes
came to Ka-opua-ua (storm cloud). They
heard the shouting of other people and hurried
along until they met the Namunawa people,
the eepas, carrying a boat, pushing it down.
When they told the eepas that the chief had
already started on his journey with double
canoes, the eepas left their boat there to slowly
decay, but it is said that it lasted many centuries.</p>

<p>The people who made this boat were the
second class of the little people living at Waolani,
having the characters of human beings, yet
having also the power of the fairy people. These
were the men of the time of Kane and the gods.</p>

<p>Kahanai and his friends were in their boat
when a strong wind swept down Nuuanu, carrying
the dry leaves of the mountains and sweeping
them into the sea. The waves were white
as the boat was blown out into the ocean. Kahanai
steered by magic power, and the boat like
lightning swept away from the islands to the
homes of Ku and Hina. The strong wind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the swift current were with the boat, and the
voyage was through the waves like swift lightning
flashing through clouds.</p>

<p>Ku and Hiilei saw the boat coming. Its
signs were in the heavens. Ku came and asked
the travellers, "What boat is this, and from what
place has it come?"</p>

<p>Kahanai said, "This boat has come from Waolani,
the home of the gods Kane and Kanaloa
and of Ke-ao-mele-mele."</p>

<p>Then Ku asked again, "Whose child are you?"</p>

<p>He replied, "The son of Ku and Hina."</p>

<p>"How many other children in your family?"</p>

<p>He said: "There are three of us. I am the
boy and there are two sisters, Paliula and Ke-ao-mele-mele.
I have been sent by Ke-ao-mele-mele
to get Kau-mai-liula and Kau-lana-iki-pokii
to go to Oahu."</p>

<p>Ku and his wife agreed to the call of the messenger
for their boy Kau-mai-liula.</p>

<p>When Kahanai saw him he knew that there
was no other one so fine as this young man who
quickly consented to go to Oahu with his servants.</p>

<p>Ku called for some beautiful red boats with
red sails, red paddles,&mdash;everything red. Four
good boatmen were provided for each boat, men
who came from the land of Ulu-nui&mdash;the land
of the yellow sea and the black sea of Kane&mdash;and
obeyed the call of Mo-o-inanea. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
kupua power. They were relatives of Kane
and Kanaloa.</p>

<p>The daughter of Hina and Olopana, Kau-lana-iki-pokii,
cried to go with her brother, but
Mo-o-inanea called for her dragon family to make
a boat for her and ordered one of the sorcerer
dragons to go with her and guard her. They
called the most beautiful shells of the sea to
become the boats for the girl and her attendants.
They followed the boats of Kahanai. With one
stroke of the paddles the boats passed through
the seas around the home of the gods. With
the second stroke they broke through all the
boundaries of the great ocean and with the third
dashed into the harbor of old Honolulu, then
known as Kou.</p>

<p>When the boats of Kahanai and Kau-mai-liula
came to the surf of Mamala, there was great
shouting inland of Kou, the voices of the eepas
of Waolani. Mists and rainbows rested over
Waolani. The menehunes gathered in great
multitudes at the call of Kane, who had seen the
boats approaching.</p>

<p>The menehune people ran down to lift up the
boats belonging to the young chief. They made
a line from Waolani to the sea. They lifted up
the boats and passed them from hand to hand
without any effort, shouting with joy.</p>

<p>While these chiefs were going up to Waolani,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Ke-ao-mele-mele came from Hawaii in her cloud
boats.</p>

<p>Kane had told the menehunes to prepare
houses quickly for her. It was done like the
motion of the eye.</p>

<p>Ke-ao-mele-mele entered her house, rested,
and after a time practised the hula.</p>

<p>The chiefs also had houses prepared, which
they entered.</p>

<p>The shell boats found difficulty in entering
the bay because the other boats were in the way.
So they turned off to the eastern side of the
harbor. Thus the ancient name of that side
was given Ke-awa-lua (the second harbor, or
the second landing-place in the harbor). Here
they landed very quietly. The shell boats became
very small and Kau-lana and her companions
took them and hid them in their clothes.
They went along the beach, saw some fish. The
attendants took them for the girl. This gave
the name Kau-lana-iki-pokii to that place to this
day. As they went along, the dragon friend
made the signs of a high chief appear over the
girl. The red rain and arching bow were over
her, so the name was given to that place, Ka-ua-koko-ula
(blood rain), which is the name to this
day.</p>

<p>The dragon changed her body and carried the
girl up Nuuanu Valley very swiftly to the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of Ke-ao-mele-mele (the maiden of the golden
cloud) without the knowledge of Kane and the
others. They heard the hula of Ke-ao-mele-mele.
Soon she felt that some one was outside, and
looking saw the girl and her friend, with the
signs of a chief over her.</p>

<p>So she called:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Is that you, O eye of the day?<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O lightning-like eye from Kahiki,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The remembered one coming to me.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The strong winds have been blowing,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling comes into my breast,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger perhaps is outside,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;A woman whose sign is the fog,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger and yet my young sister,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of the divine home-land,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful land of the setting sun<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Going down into the deep blue sea.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;You belong to the white ocean of Kane,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;You are Kau-lana-iki-pokii,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of the sunset,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The woman coming in the mist,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;In the thunder and the flash of lightning<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Quivering in the sky above.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Light falls on the earth below.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The sign of the chiefess,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The woman high up in the heavens,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Kau-lana-iki-pokii,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Enter, enter, here am I."<br />
</p>

<p>Those outside heard the call and understood
that Ke-ao-mele-mele knew who they were.
They entered and saw her in all the beauty of
her high divine blood.</p>

<p>They kissed. Kau-lana told how she had
come. Ke-ao-mele-mele told the dragon to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and stay on the mountain by the broken pali at
the head of Nuuanu Valley. So she went to
the precipice and became the watchman of that
place. She was the first dragon on the islands.
She watched with magic power. Later, Mo-o-inanea
came with many dragons to watch over
the islands. Ke-ao-mele-mele taught her young
sister the different hulas and meles, so that they
were both alike in their power.</p>

<p>When the young men heard hula voices in the
other houses they thought they would go and
see the dancers. At the hour of twilight Waolani
shook as if in an earthquake, and there was
thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>The young men and Anuenue went to the
house and saw the girls dancing, and wondered
how Kau-lana had come from the far-off land.</p>

<p>Ke-ao-mele-mele foretold the future for the
young people. She told Kau-lana that she
would never marry, but should have magic
medicine power for all coming days, and Kahanai
should have the power over all customs of priests
and sorcerers and knowledge of sacrifices, and
should be the bosom friend of the medicine-goddess.
She said that they would all go to
Waipio, Hawaii. Kane, Kanaloa, and Anuenue
approved of her commands.</p>

<p>Ke-ao-mele-mele sent Kau-lana to Hawaii to
tell Paliula to come and live with them at Waipio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and find Kahanai once more. Kau-lana hastened
to Hawaii in her shell boat. She called,
"O my red shell boat of the deep blue sea and
the black sea, come up to me."</p>

<p>The shell boat appeared on the surface of the
sea, floating. The girl was carried swiftly to
Hawaii. There she found Waka and Paliula
and took them to Waipio. They lived for a
time there, then all went to Waolani to complete
the marriage of Ke-ao-mele-mele to Kau-mai-liula.</p>

<p>Kane sent Waka and Anuenue for Ku and
Hiilei, Hina and Olopana with Mo-o-inanea to
come to Oahu.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea prepared large ocean-going canoes
for the two families, but she and her people went
in their magic boats.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea told them they would never
return to these lands, but should find their future
home in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Waka went on Ku's boat, Anuenue was with
Hina. Ku and his friends looked back, the land
was almost lost; they soon saw nothing until the
mountains of Oahu appeared before them.</p>

<p>They landed at Heeia on the northern side of
the Nuuanu precipice, went over to Waolani,
and met all the family who had come before.</p>

<p>Before Mo-o-inanea left her land she changed
it, shutting up all the places where her family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
had lived. She told all her kupua dragon family
to come with her to the place where the gods
had gone. Thus she made the old lands entirely
different from any other lands, so that no
other persons but gods or ghosts could live in
them.</p>

<p>Then she rose up to come away. The land
was covered with rainclouds, heavy and black.
The land disappeared and is now known as "The
Hidden Land of Kane."</p>

<p>She landed on Western Oahu, at Waialua, so
that place became the home of the dragons, and
it was filled with the dragons from Waialua to
Ewa.</p>

<p>This was the coming of dragons to the Hawaiian
Islands.</p>

<p>At the time of the marriage of Ke-ao-mele-mele
and Kau-mai-liula, the Beautiful Daughter of
Sunset came from the island Hawaii bringing
the two trees Makalei and Makuukao, which
prepared cooked food and fish. When she heard
the call to the marriage she came with the
trees. Makalei brought great multitudes of
fish from all the ocean to the Koo-lau-poko
side of the island Oahu. The ocean was red
with the fish.</p>

<p>Makuukao came to Nuuanu Valley with
Kau-lana, entered Waolani, and provided plenty
of food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Makalei started to come up from the
sea.</p>

<p>Kau-lana-iki-pokii told the gods and people
that there must not be any noise when that
great tree came up from the sea. They must
hear and remain silent.</p>

<p>When the tree began to come to the foot of
the pali, the menehunes and eepas were astonished
and began to shout with a great voice, for
they thought this was a mighty kupua from
Kahiki coming to destroy them.</p>

<p>When they had shouted, Makalei fell down
at the foot of the pali near Ka-wai-nui, and lies
there to this day. So this tree never came to
Waolani and the fish were scattered around the
island.</p>

<p>Kau-lana's wrath was very great, and he told
Kane and the others to punish these noisy ones,
to take them away from this wonderful valley
of the gods. He said, "No family of these must
dwell on Waolani." Thus the fairies and the
gnomes were driven away and scattered over the
islands.</p>

<p>For a long time the Maiden of the Golden
Cloud and her husband, Twilight Resting in
the Sky, ruled over all the islands even to the
mysterious lands of the ocean. When death
came they laid aside their human bodies and
never made use of them again&mdash;but as au<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>makuas,
or ghost-gods, they assumed their divine
forms, and in the skies, over the mountains and
valleys, they have appeared for hundreds of
years watching over and cheering their descendants.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p class="center">PUNA AND THE DRAGON</p>


<p>Two images of goddesses were clothed in
yellow kapa cloth and worshipped in the
temples. One was Kiha-wahine, a noted dragon-goddess,
and the other was Haumea, who was also
known as Papa, the wife of Wakea, a great ancestor-god
among the Polynesians.</p>

<p>Haumea is said to have taken as her husband,
Puna, a chief of Oahu. He and his people were
going around the island. The surf was not very
good, and they wanted to find a better place. At
last they found a fine surf-place where a beautiful
woman was floating on the sea.</p>

<p>She called to Puna, "This is not a good place
for surf." He asked, "Where is there a place?"
She answered, "I know where there is one, far
outside." She desired to get Puna. So they
swam way out in the sea until they were out of
sight nor could they see the sharp peaks of the
mountains. They forgot everything else but
each other. This woman was Kiha-wahine.</p>

<p>The people on the beach wailed, but did not
take canoes to help them. They swam over to
Molokai. Here they left their surf-boards on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the beach and went inland. They came to the
cave house of the woman. He saw no man
inside nor did he hear any voice, all was quiet.</p>

<p>Puna stayed there as a kind of prisoner and
obeyed the commands of the woman. She took
care of him and prepared his food. They lived
as husband and wife for a long time, and at last
his real body began to change.</p>

<p>Once he went out of the cave. While standing
there he heard voices, loud and confused. He
wanted to see what was going on, but he could
not go, because the woman had laid her law on
him, that if he went away he would be killed.</p>

<p>He returned to the cave and asked the woman,
"What is that noise I heard from the sea?" She
said: "Surf-riding, perhaps, or rolling the maika
stone. Some one is winning and you heard the
shouts." He said, "It would be fine for me to
see the things you have mentioned." She said,
"To-morrow will be a good time for you to go
and see."</p>

<p>In the morning he went down to the sea to the
place where the people were gathered together
and saw many sports.</p>

<p>While he was watching, one of the men, Hinole,
the brother of his wife, saw him and was pleased.
When the sports were through he invited Puna
to go to their house and eat and talk.</p>

<p>Hinole asked him, "Whence do you come, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
what house do you live in?" He said, "I am
from the mountains, and my house is a cave."
Hinole meditated, for he had heard of the loss
of Puna at Oahu. He loved his brother-in-law,
and asked, "How did you come to this place?"
Puna told him all the story. Then Hinole told
him his wife was a goddess. "When you return
and come near to the place, go very easily and
softly, and you will see her in her real nature, as
a mo-o, or dragon; but she knows all that you
are doing and what we are saying. Now listen
to a parable. Your first wife, Haumea, is the
first born of all the other women. Think of the
time when she was angry with you. She had
been sporting with you and then she said in a
tired way, 'I want the water.' You asked, 'What
water do you want?' She said, 'The water from
Poliahu of Mauna Kea.' You took a water-jar
and made a hole so that the water always leaked
out, and then you went to the pit of Pele. That
woman Pele was very old and blear-eyed, so that
she could not see you well, and you returned to
Haumea. She was that wife of yours. If you
escape this mo-o wife she will seek my life. It
is my thought to save your life, so that you can
look into the eyes of your first wife."</p>

<p>The beautiful dragon-woman had told him to
cry with a loud voice when he went back to the
cave. But when Puna was going back he went
slowly and softly, and saw his wife as a dragon,
and understood the words of Hinole. He tried
to hide, but was trembling and breathing hard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/180.jpg" width="600" height="327" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>His wife heard and quickly changed to a human
body, and cursed him, saying: "You are an evil
man coming quietly and hiding, but I heard
your breath when you thought I would not know
you. Perhaps I will eat your eyes. When you
were talking with Hinole you learned how to
come and see me."</p>

<p>The dragon-goddess was very angry, but
Puna did not say anything. She was so angry
that the hair on her neck rose up, but it was like
a whirlwind, soon quiet and the anger over.
They dwelt together, and the woman trusted
Puna, and they had peace.</p>

<p>One day Puna was breathing hard, for he was
thirsty and wanted the water of the gods.</p>

<p>The woman heard his breathing, and asked,
"Why do you breathe like this?" He said: "I
want water. We have dwelt together a long
time and now I need the water." "What water
is this you want?" He said, "I must have the
water of Poliahu of Mauna Kea, the snow
covered mountain of Hawaii."</p>

<p>She said, "Why do you want that water?"
He said: "The water of that place is cold and
heavy with ice. In my youth my good grandparents
always brought water from that place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
for me. Wherever I went I carried that water
with me, and when it was gone more would be
brought to me, and so it has been up to the time
that I came to dwell with you. You have water
and I have been drinking it, but it is not the same
as the water mixed with ice, and heavy. But
I would not send you after it, because I know it
is far away and attended with toil unfit for you,
a woman."</p>

<p>The woman bent her head down, then lifted
her eyes, and said: "Your desire for water is not
a hard thing to satisfy. I will go and get the
water."</p>

<p>Before he had spoken of his desire he had
made a little hole in the water-jar, as Hinole had
told him, that the woman might spend a long
time and let him escape.</p>

<p>She arose and went away. He also arose and
followed. He found a canoe and crossed to
Maui. Then he found another boat going to
Hawaii and at last landed at Kau.</p>

<p>He went up and stood on the edge of the pit
of Pele. Those who were living in the crater
saw him, and cried out, "Here is a man, a husband
for our sister." He quickly went down
into the crater and dwelt with them. He told
all about his journey. Pele heard these words,
and said: "Not very long and your wife will be
here coming after you, and there will be a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
battle, but we will not let you go or you will be
killed, because she is very angry against you.
She has held you, the husband of our sister
Haumea. She should find her own husband and
not take what belongs to another. You stay
with us and at the right time you can go back
to your wife."</p>

<p>Kiha-wahine went to Poliahu, but could not
fill the water-jar. She poured the water in and
filled the jar, but when the jar was lifted it
became light. She looked back and saw the
water lying on the ground, and her husband far
beyond at the pit of Pele. Then she became
angry and called all the dragons of Molokai,
Lanai, Maui, Kahoolawe, and Hawaii.</p>

<p>When she had gathered all the dragons she
went up to Kilauea and stood on the edge of
the crater and called all the people below, telling
them to give her the husband. They refused
to give Puna up, crying out: "Where is your
husband? This is the husband of our sister; he
does not belong to you, O mischief-maker."</p>

<p>Then the dragon-goddess said, "If you do not
give up this man, of a truth I will send quickly
all my people and fill up this crater and capture
all your fires." The dragons threw their drooling
saliva in the pit, and almost destroyed the
fire of the pit where Pele lived, leaving Ka-moho-alii's
place untouched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the fire moved and began to rise with
great strength, burning off all the saliva of the
dragons. Kiha-wahine and the rest of the
dragons could not stand the heat even a little
while, for the fire caught them and killed a large
part of them in that place. They tried to hide
in the clefts of the rocks. The earthquakes
opened the rocks and some of the dragons hid,
but fire followed the earthquakes and the fleeing
dragons. Kiha-wahine ran and leaped down the
precipice into a fish-pond called by the name of
the shadow, or aka, of the dragon, Loko-aka
(the shadow lake).</p>

<p>So she was imprisoned in the pond, husbandless,
scarcely escaping with her life. When she
went back to Molokai she meant to kill Hinole,
because she was very angry for his act in aiding
Puna to escape. She wanted to punish him,
but Hinole saw the trouble coming from his
sister, so arose and leaped into the sea, becoming
a fish in the ocean.</p>

<p>When he dove into the sea Kiha-wahine went
down after him and tried to find him in the small
and large coral caves, but could not catch him.
He became the Hinalea, a fish dearly loved by
the fishermen of the islands. The dragon-goddess
continued seeking, swimming swiftly from place
to place.</p>

<p>Ounauna saw her passing back and forth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
said, "What are you seeking, O Kiha-wahine?"
She said, "I want Hinole." Ounauna said:
"Unless you listen to me you cannot get him,
just as when you went to Hawaii you could not
get your husband from Pele. You go and get
the vine inalua and come back and make a
basket and put it down in the sea. After a while
dive down and you will find that man has come
inside. Then catch him."</p>

<p>The woman took the vine, made the basket,
came down and put it in the sea. She left it
there a little while, then dove down. There was
no Hinole in the basket, but she saw him swimming
along outside of the basket. She went up,
waited awhile, came down again and saw him
still swimming outside. This she did again and
again, until her eyes were red because she could
not catch him. Then she was angry, and went
to Ounauna and said: "O slave, I will kill you
to-day. Perhaps you told the truth, but I
have been deceived, and will chase you until
you die."</p>

<p>Ounauna said: "Perhaps we should talk before
I die. I want you to tell me just what you have
done, then I will know whether you followed
directions. Tell me in a few words. Perhaps
I forgot something."</p>

<p>The dragon said, "I am tired of your words
and I will kill you." Then Ounauna said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
"Suppose I die, what will you do to correct any
mistakes you have made?"</p>

<p>Then she told how she had taken vines and
made a basket and used it. Ounauna said: "I
forgot to tell you that you must get some sea
eggs and crabs, pound and mix them together
and put them inside the basket. Put the mouth
of the basket down. Leave it for a little while,
then dive down and find your brother inside.
He will not come out, and you can catch
him." This is the way the Hinalea is caught to
this day.</p>

<p>After she had caught her brother she took him
to the shore to kill him, but he persuaded her
to set him free. This she did, compelling him
ever after to retain the form of the fish Hinalea.</p>

<p>Kiha-wahine then went to the island Maui
and dwelt in a deep pool near the old royal town
of Lahaina.</p>

<p>After Pele had her battle with the dragons, and
Puna had escaped according to the directions of
Hinole, he returned to Oahu and saw his wife,
Haumea, a woman with many names, as if she
were the embodiment of many goddesses.</p>

<p>After Puna disappeared, Kou became the new
chief of Oahu. Puna went to live in the mountains
above Kalihi-uka. One day Haumea went
out fishing for crabs at Heeia, below the precipice
of Koolau, where she was accustomed to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p><p>Puna came to a banana plantation, ate, and lay
down to rest. He fell fast asleep and the watchmen
of the new chief found him. They took his
loin-cloth, and tied his hands behind his back,
bringing him thus to Kou, who killed him and
hung the body in the branches of a breadfruit-tree.
It is said that this was at Wai-kaha-lulu
just below the steep diving rocks of the Nuuanu
stream.</p>

<p>When Haumea returned from gathering moss
and fish to her home in Kalihi-uka, she heard of
the death of her husband. She had taken an
akala vine, made a pa-u, or skirt, of it, and tied
it around her when she went fishing, but she forgot
all about it, and as she hurried down to see
the body of her husband, all the people turned
to look at her, and shouted out, "This is the wife
of the dead man."</p>

<p>She found Puna hanging on the branches.
Then she made that breadfruit-tree open. Leaving
her pa-u on the ground where she stood,
she stepped inside the tree and bade it close
about her and appear the same as before.
The akala of which the pa-u had been made
lay where it was left, took root and grew into a
large vine.</p>

<p>The fat of the body of Puna fell down through
the branches and the dogs ate below the tree.
One of these dogs belonged to the chief Kou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
It came back to the house, played with the chief,
then leaped, caught him by the throat and killed
him.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This is the same legend as "The Wonderful
Breadfruit Tree" published in the "Legends of Old
Honolulu," but the names are changed and the time is
altered from the earliest days of Hawaiian lore to the
almost historic period of King Kakuhihewa, whose under-chief
mentioned in this legend gave the name to Old
Honolulu, as for centuries it bore the name "Kou." The
legend is new, however, in so far as it gives the account

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p class="center">KE-AU-NINI</p>


<p>Ku-aha-ilo was a demon who had no
parents. His great effort was to find something
to eat&mdash;men or any other kind of food. He
was a kupua&mdash;one who was sometimes an animal
and sometimes a man. He was said to be the
father of Pele, the goddess of volcanic fires.</p>

<p>Nakula-uka and Nakula-kai were the parents
of Hiilei, who was the mother of Ke-au-nini.
Nakula-kai told her husband that she was with
child. He told her that he was glad, and if it
were a boy he would name him, but if a girl she
should name the child.</p>

<p>The husband went out fishing, and Nakula-kai
went to see her parents, Kahuli and Kakela.
The hot sun was rising, so she put leaves over
her head and came to the house. Her father
was asleep. She told her mother about her
condition. Kahuli awoke and turning over
shook the land by his motion, <i>i.e.</i>, the far-away
divine land of Nuu-mea-lani. He asked his
daughter why she had come, and when she told
him he studied the signs and foretold the birth
of a girl who should be named Hina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Kahuli's wife questioned his knowledge. He
said: "I will prepare awa in a cup, cover it with
white kapa, and chant a prayer. I will lift the
cover, and if the awa is still there I am at fault.
If the awa has disappeared I am correct. It will
be proved by the awa disappearing that a girl
will be born.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"I was up above Niihau.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Ku! O Kane! O Lono!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I have dug a hole,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Planted the bamboo;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The bamboo has grown;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Find that bamboo!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;It has grown old.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The green-barked bamboo has a green bark;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The white-barked bamboo has a white bark.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Fragments of rain are stinging the skin&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Rain fell that day in storms,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Water pouring in streams.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Mohoalii is by the island,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Island cut off at birth from the mainland;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Many islands as children were born."<br />
</p>

<p>A girl was born, and the grandparents kept the
child, calling her Hina. She cried, and the grandmother
took her in her arms and sang:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Fishing, fishing, your father is fishing,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Catching the opoa-pea."<br />
</p>

<p>Nakula-kai went down to her home. Her husband
returned from fishing. He said he thought
another child was born. He had heard the
thunder, but no storm. She told him that a
boy was born. Nakula-uka named that boy
Ke-au-miki (stormy or choppy current). Ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
days afterward another boy was born. He was
named Ke-au-kai (current toward the beach).</p>

<p>These children had no food but awa. Their
hair was not cut. They were taken inside a
tabu temple and brought up. Nakula-uka and
his wife after a long time had another girl named
Hiilei (lifted like a lei on the head). The grandparents
took the child. She was very beautiful
and was kept tabu. Her husband should be
either a king or a male kupua of very high birth.
When she had grown up she heard noises below
her woodland home several times, and she was
very curious. She was told, "That comes from
the surf-riding."</p>

<p>Hiilei wanted to go down and see. The
grandmother said, "Do not go, for it would mean
your death." Once more came the noise, and
she was told it was "spear-throwing." The girl
wanted to know how that was done. The grandparents
warned her that there was great danger,
saying: "The path is full of trouble. Dragons
lie beside the way. Ku-aha-ilo, the mo-o
[dragon], is travelling through the sky, the
clouds, the earth, and the forest. His tongue is
thrusting every way to find food. He is almost
starved, and now plans to assume his human
form and come to Nuu-mea-lani, seeking to find
some one for food. You should not go down to
the beach of Honua-lewa [the field of sports]."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>But Hiilei was very persistent, so the grandmother
at last gave permission, saying: "I will
let you go, but here are my commands. You are
quite determined to go down, but listen to me.
Ku-aha-ilo is very hungry, and is seeking food
these days. When you go down to the grove of
kukui-trees, there Ku-aha-ilo will await you and
you will be afraid that he will catch you. Do not
be afraid. Pass that place bravely. Go on the
lower side&mdash;the valley-side&mdash;and you cannot be
touched. When that one sees you he will change
into his god-body and stand as a mo-o. Do
not show that you are afraid. He cannot touch
you unless you are afraid and flee. Keep your
fear inside and give 'Aloha' and say, 'You are a
strangely beautiful one.' The dragon will think
you are not afraid. Then that mo-o will take
another body. He will become a great caterpillar.
Caterpillars will surround you. You
must give 'Aloha' and praise. Thus you must
do with all the mysterious bodies of Ku-aha-ilo
without showing any fear. Then Ku-aha-ilo
will become a man and will be your husband."</p>

<p>So the girl went down, dressed gorgeously by
the grandmother in a skirt of rainbow colors,
flowers of abundant perfumes&mdash;nothing about
her at fault.</p>

<p>She came to the kukui grove and looked all
around, seeing nothing, but passing further along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
she saw a mist rising. A strong wind was coming.
The sun was hot in the sky, making her
cheeks red like lehua flowers. She went up
some high places looking down on the sea. Then
she heard footsteps behind her. She looked
back and saw a strange body following. She
became afraid and trembled, but she remembered
the words of her grandmother, and turned and
said, "Aloha," and the strange thing went away.
She went on and again heard a noise and looked
back. A whirlwind was coming swiftly after
her. Then there was thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>Hiilei said: "Aloha. Why do you try to make
me afraid? Come in your right body, for I know
that you are a real man."</p>

<p>Everything passed away. She went on again,
but after a few steps she felt an earthquake.
Afraid, she sat down. She saw a great thing
rising like a cloud twisting and shutting out the
sun, moving and writhing&mdash;a great white piece
of earth in front of a whirlwind.</p>

<p>She was terribly frightened and fell flat on the
ground as if dead. Then she heard the spirit
of her grandmother calling to her to send away
her fear, saying: "This is the one of whom I told
you. Don't be afraid." She looked at the cloud,
and the white thing became omaomao (green).
Resolutely she stood up, shook her rainbow
skirt and flowers. The perfumes were scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in the air and she started on. Then the dragons,
a multitude, surrounded her, climbing upon her
to throw her down. Her skin was creeping, but
she remembered her grandmother and said:
"Alas, O most beautiful ones, this is the first
time I have ever seen you. If my grandmother
were here we would take you back to our home
and entertain you, and you should be my playmates.
But I cannot return, so I must say
'Farewell.'"</p>

<p>Then the dragons disappeared and the caterpillars
came into view after she had gone on a
little way. The caterpillars' eyes were protruding
as they rose up and came against her, but
she said, "Aloha."</p>

<p>Then she saw another form of Ku-aha-ilo&mdash;a
stream of blood flowing like running water. She
was more frightened than at any other time, and
cried to her grandfather: "E Kahuli, I am
afraid! Save my life, O my grandfather!" He
did not know she had gone down. He told his
wife that he saw Ku-aha-ilo surrounding someone
on the path. He went into his temple and
prayed:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Born is the night,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Born is the morning,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Born is the thunder,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Born is the lightning,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Born is the heavy rain,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Born is the rain which calls us;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds of the sky gather."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Kahuli twisted his kapa clothes full of
lightning and threw them into the sky. A fierce
and heavy rain began to fall. Streams of water
rushed toward the place where Hiilei stood fighting
with that stream of blood in which the dragon
was floating. The blood was all washed away
and the dragon became powerless.</p>

<p>Ku-aha-ilo saw that he had failed in all these
attempts to terrify Hiilei. His eyes flashed and
he opened his mouth. His tongue was thrusting
viciously from side to side. His red mouth was
like the pit of Pele. His teeth were gnashing,
his tail lashing.</p>

<p>Hiilei stood almost paralyzed by fear, but remembered
her grandmother. She felt that death
was near when she faced this awful body of
Ku-aha-ilo. But she hid her fear and called a
welcome to this dragon. Then the dragon fell
into pieces, which all became nothing. The
fragments flew in all directions.</p>

<p>While Hiilei was watching this, all the evil
disappeared and a handsome man stood before
her. Hiilei asked him gently, "Who are you,
and from what place do you come?" He said,
"I am a man of this place." "No," said Hiilei,
"you are not of this land. My grandparents
and I are the only ones. This is our land. From
what place do you come?" He replied: "I am
truly from the land above the earth, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
come to find a wife for myself. Perhaps you will
be my wife." She said that she did not want a
husband at that time. She wanted to go down
to the sea.</p>

<p>He persuaded her to marry him and then go
down and tell her brothers that she had married
Ku-aha-ilo. If a boy was born he must be called
Ke-au-nini-ula-o-ka-lani (the red, restful current
of the heavens). This would be their only child.
He gave her signs for the boy, saying, "When
the boy says to you, 'Where is my father?' you
can tell him, 'Here is the stick or club Kaaona
and this malo or girdle Ku-ke-anuenue.' He
must take these things and start out to find me."
He slowly disappeared, leaving Hiilei alone. She
went down to the sea. The people saw her
coming, a very beautiful woman, and they
shouted a glad welcome.</p>

<p>She went out surf-riding, sported awhile, and
then her grandfather came and took her home.
After a time came the signs of the birth of a chief.
Her son was born and named Ke-au-nini. This
was in the land Kuai-he-lani. Kahuli almost
turned over. The land was shaken and tossed.
This was one of the divine lands from which the
ancestors of the Hawaiians came. Pii-moi, a
god of the sun, asked Akoa-koa, the coral, "What
is the matter with the land?" Akoa-koa replied,
"There is a kupua&mdash;a being with divine powers&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>being
born, with the gifts of Ku-aha-ilo." Pii-moi
was said to be below Papaku-lolo, taking care
of the foundation of the earth. The brothers
were in their temple. Ke-au-kai heard the signs
in the leaves and knew that his sister had a child,
and proposed to his brother to go over and get
the child. The mother had left it on a pile of
sugar-cane leaves. They met their sister and
asked for the child. Then they took it, wrapped
it in a soft kapa and went back to the temple.
The temple drum sounded as they came in,
beaten by invisible hands.</p>

<p>The boy grew up. The mother after a time
wanted to see the child, and went to the temple.
She had to wait a little, then the boy came out
and said he would soon come to her. She rejoiced
to see such a beautiful boy as her Ke-au-nini-ula-o-ka-lani.
They talked and rejoiced in
their mutual affection. An uncle came and sent
her away for a time. The boy returned to the
temple, and his uncle told him he could soon go
to be with his mother. Then came an evil night
and the beating of the spirit drum. A mist
covered the land. There was wailing among the
menehunes (fairy folk). Ke-au-nini went away
covered by the mist, and no one saw him go.</p>

<p>He came to his grandfather's house, saw an
old man sleeping and a war-club by the door. He
took this club and lifted it to strike the old man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
but the old man caught the club. The boy
dropped it and tried to catch the old man. The
old man held him and asked who he was and to
what family he belonged. The boy said: "I
belong to Kahuli and Kakela, to Nakula-uka and
Nakula-kai. I am the son of Ku-aha-ilo and
Hiilei. I have been brought up by Ke-au-miki
and Ke-au-kai. I seek my mother."</p>

<p>The old man arose, took his drum and beat it.
Hiilei and her mother came out to meet the boy.
They put sacrifices in their temple for him and
chanted to their ancestor-gods:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O Keke-hoa-lani, dwell here;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Here are wind and rain."<br />
</p>

<p>By and by Ke-au-nini asked his mother, "Where
is my father?" She told him: "You have no
father in the lands of the earth. He belongs to
the atmosphere above. You cannot go to find
him. He never told me the pathway to his
home. You had better stay with me." He
replied: "No I cannot stay here. I must go to
find my father." He was very earnest in his
purpose.</p>

<p>His mother said: "If you make a mistake, your
father will kill you and then eat you and take
all your lands. He will destroy the forests and
the food plants, and all will be devoured by your
father. His kingdom is tabu. If you go, take
great care of the gifts, for with these things you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
succeed, but without them you die." She showed
him the war-club and the rainbow-girdle, and
gave them into his care. The boy took the
gifts, kissed his mother, went outside and
looked up into the sky.</p>

<p>He saw wonderful things. A long object
passed before him, part of which was on the earth,
but the top was lost in the clouds. This was
Niu-loa-hiki, one of the ancestor-gods of the
night. This was a very tall cocoanut-tree, from
which the bark of cocoanuts fell in the shape
of boats. He took one of these boats in his
hands, saying, "How can I ride in this small
canoe?"</p>

<p>He went down to the sea, put the bark boat in
the water, got in and sailed away until the land
of Nuu-mea-lani was lost. His uncle, Ke-au-kai,
saw him going away, and prayed to the aumakuas
(ancestral ghost-gods) to guard the boy. The
boy heard the soft voice of the far-off surf, and
as he listened he saw a girl floating in the surf.
He turned his boat and joined her. She told him
to go back, or he would be killed. She was
Moho-nana, the first-born child of Ku-aha-ilo.</p>

<p>When she learned that this was her half-brother,
she told him that her father was sleeping.
If he awoke, the boy would be killed.</p>

<p>The boy went to the shore of this strange land.
Ku-aha-ilo saw him coming, and breathed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the wind of his home against the boy. It was
like a black whirlwind rushing to the sea.</p>

<p>The boy went on toward his father's tabu place,
up to Kalewa, in the face of the storm. He saw
the tail of Ku-aha-ilo sweep around against him
to kill him. He began his chants and incantations
and struck his war-club on the ground.
Lava came out and fire was burning all around
him. He could not strike the tail, nor could the
tail strike him. Ku-aha-ilo sent many other
enemies, but the war-club turned them aside.
The earth was shaking, almost turning upside
down as it was struck by the war-club. Great
openings let lava fires out. Ku-aha-ilo came out
of his cave to fight. His mouth was open, his
tongue outstretching, his eyes glaring, but the
boy was not afraid. He took his club, whirled
it in his hand, thinking his father would see it,
but his father did not see it. The boy leaped
almost inside the mouth and struck with the club
up and down, every stroke making an opening
for fire.</p>

<p>The father tried to shut his mouth, but the
boy leaped to one side and struck the father's
head. The blow glanced aside and made a great
hole in the earth, which let out fire. The dragon
body disappeared and came back in another form,
as a torrent of blood. Ke-au-nini thrust it aside.</p>

<p>Then a handsome man stood before him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
wild eyes, demanding who he was. Ku-aha-ilo
had forgotten his son, and the miraculous war-club
which he had given to Hiilei, so he began to
fight with his hands. Ke-au-nini laid his club
down. The father was near the end of his
strength, and said, "Let our anger cease, that we
may know each other." The boy was very angry
and said: "You have treated me cruelly, when I
only came to see you and to love you. You
would have taken my young life for sacrifice.
Now you tell me you belong to the temple of my
ancestors in Nuu-mea-lani." Then he caught
his father and lifted him up. He tossed him,
dizzy and worn out, into the air, and catching the
body broke it over his knee. Ku-aha-ilo had
killed and eaten all his people, so that no one was
left in his land. The boy's sister saw the battle
and went away to Ka-lewa-lani (the divine far-away
cloud-land).</p>

<p>Ke-au-nini returned on his ocean journey to
Nuu-mea-lani. The uncle saw a mist covering
the sea and saw the sign of a chief in it, and knew
that the boy was not dead, but had killed Ku-aha-ilo.
The boy came and greeted them and
told the story. He remained some time in the
temple and dreamed of a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>The brothers talked about the power of Ke-au-nini
who had killed his father, a man without
parents, part god and part man. They thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
he would now kill them. Ke-au-nini became pale
and thin and sick, desiring the woman of his
dream. Finally he told the brothers to find that
woman or he would kill them.</p>

<p>Ke-au-kai told him that he would consult the
gods. Then he made a red boat with a red mast
and a red sail and told Ke-au-miki to go after
Hiilei, their sister.</p>

<p>Hiilei came down to stay with her son while
the brothers went away to find the girl. Ke-au-kai
(broad sea-current) said to Ke-au-miki
(chopped-up current): "You sit in front, I behind.
Let this be our law. You must not turn
back to look at me. You must not speak to me.
I must not speak to you, or watch you."</p>

<p>Ke-au-miki went to his place in the boat. The
other stood with one foot in the boat and one on
the land. He told the boy they would go. If
they found a proper girl they would return; if
not, they would not come back. They pushed
the boat far out to sea by one paddle-stroke.
Another stroke and land was out of sight.
Swiftly leaped the boat over the ocean.</p>

<p>They saw birds on the island Kaula. One
bird flew up. Heavy winds almost upset the
boat and filled it with water up to their chins.
They caught the paddles, bailing-cups, and loose
boards for seats, and held them safe.</p>

<p>The wind increased like a cyclone over them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Thus in the storm they floated on the sea. Ke-au-nini
by his sorcery saw the swamped canoe.
He ran and told his mother. She sent him to the
temple to utter incantations:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O wind, wini-wini [sharp-pointed];<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O wind full of stinging points;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O wind rising at Vavau,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;At Hii-ka-lani;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped upon, trodden upon by the wind.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Niihau is the island;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Ka-pali-kala-hale is the chief."<br />
</p>

<p>This chant of Ke-au-nini reached Ke-au-kai, and
the wind laid aside its anger. Its strength was
made captive and the sea became calm.</p>

<p>The boat came to the surface, and they bailed
it out and took their places. Ke-au-kai said to
his brother: "What a wonderful one is that boy
of ours! We must go to Niihau." They saw
birds, met a boat and fisherman, and found
Niihau. When the Niihau people saw them
coming on a wonderful surf wave, they shouted
about the arrival of the strangers. The chief
Ka-pali-kala-hale came down as the surf swept
the boat inland. He took the visitors to his
house and gave gifts of food, kapas, and many
other things. Then they went on their way.
When they were between Niihau and Kauai, the
wind drove the boat back. A whirlwind threw
water into the boat, swamping it. It was sinking
and all the goods were floating away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Ke-au-nini again saw the signs of trouble
and chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"The wind of Kauai comes; it touches; it strikes;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Rising, whirling; boat filled with water;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The boat slipping down in the sea;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The outrigger sticks in the sand.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Kauai is the island;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Ka-pali-o-ka-la-lau is chief."<br />
</p>

<p>The sea became calm. The boat was righted
and the floating goods were put in. They met
canoes and went on a mighty surf wave up the
sands of the beach.</p>

<p>The people shouted, "Aloha!" The chiefess of
that part of Kauai was surf-riding and heard the
people shouting welcome, so she came to land and
found the visitors sitting on the sand, resting.
She took them to the royal home. All the people
of Kauai came together to meet the strangers,
making many presents.</p>

<p>The brothers found no maids sufficiently perfect,
so they crossed over to Oahu, meeting other
trials. At last they went to Hawaii to the place
where Haina-kolo lived, a chiefess and a kua
(goddess).</p>

<p>This was above Kawaihae. They went to
Kohala, seeking the dream-land of Ke-au-nini,
and then around to Waipio Valley. There they
saw a rainbow resting over the home of a tabu
chief, Ka-lua-hine. They landed near the door
of the Under-world. This entrance is through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
cave under water. There they saw the shadow
of Milu, the ruler of the dead. Milu's people
called out, "Here are men breaking the tabu of
the chief." Olopana, a very high chief, heard
the shouts while he was in the temple in the
valley. He saw the visitors chased by the people,
running here and there. Haina-kolo, his sister,
was tabu. Watchmen were on the outside of
her house. They also saw the two men and the
people pursuing, and told Haina-kolo, and she
ordered one of the watchmen to go out and say
to the strangers, "Oh, run swiftly; run, run, and
come inside this temple!" They heard and ran
in. The people stopped on the outside of the
wall around the house. This was a tabu drum
place, and not a temple of safety.</p>

<p>Olopana was in the heiau (temple) Pakaalana.
Haina-kolo asked who they were. They
said they were from Hawaii. She said, "No,
you have come from the sea." Hoo-lei-palaoa,
one of her watchmen, called, and men came and
caught the two strangers, taking them to Olopana,
who was very angry because they had
come into the temple of his sister. So he ordered
his men to take them at once and carry them to
a prison house to die on the morrow. He said if
the prisoners escaped, the watchmen should die
and their bodies be burned in the fire. Toward
morning the two prisoners talked together and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
uttered incantations. Ke-au-nini saw by the
signs that they were in some trouble and chanted
in the ears of the watchmen: "They shall not
die. They shall not die."</p>

<p>The watchmen reported to Olopana what they
had heard, then returned to watch. The moon
was rising and the two prisoners were talking.
Ke-au-kai told his brother to look at the moon,
saying: "This means life. The cloud passes,
morning comes." Ke-au-kai prayed and
chanted. The watchmen again reported to Olopana,
giving the words of the chant. In this
chant the family names were given. Olopana
said: "These are the names of my mother's people.
My mother is Hina. Her sister is Hiilei. Her
brothers are Ke-au-kai and Ke-au-miki. They
were all living at Kuai-he-lani. Hina and her
husband Ku went away to Waipio. There she
had her child, Haina-kolo."</p>

<p>Olopana sent messengers for Hina, who was
like the rising moon, giving life, and for her
husband Ku, who was at Napoopoo, asking them
to come and look at these prisoners. They ran
swiftly and arrived by daylight. Hina had been
troubled all night. Messengers called: "Awake!
Listen to the chant of the prisoners, captured
yesterday." And they reported the prayers of
Ke-au-kai. Hina arose and went to the heiau
(temple) and heard the story of her brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
who came also with the warriors. Olopana
heard Hina wailing with her brothers, and was
afraid that his mother would kill him because
he had treated his visitors so badly. The
strangers told her they had come to find a wife
for Ke-au-nini. They had looked at the beautiful
women of all the islands and had found none
except the woman at Waipio. Then they told
about the anger of the people, the pursuit, and
their entrance into the tabu temple.</p>

<p>Hina commanded Olopana to come before
them. He took warriors and chiefs and came
over to the temple and stood before his parents.
Hina pronounced judgment, saying: "This chief
shall live because he sent for me. The chiefs and
people who pursued shall die and be cooked in
the oven in which they thought to place the
strangers."</p>

<p>Ku's warriors captured Olopana's men and
took them away prisoners, but Olopana was
spared and made welcome by his uncle. And
they all feasted together for days. Then the
brothers prepared to go after Ke-au-nini.</p>

<p>One man who heard the wailing of the brothers
and knew of the coming of Hina went to his
house, took his wife and children and ran by way
of Hilo to Puna-luu. It was said this man took
his calabash to get water at the spring Kauwila,
and an owl picked a hole in it and let the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
out. For this the owl was injured by a stone
which was thrown at him, and he told the other
birds. They said he was rightly punished for
his fault.</p>

<p>The brothers found their red boat, launched it,
and bade farewell to the chief's people and lands.
They returned to Kuai-he-lani, like a flash of
lightning speeding along the coast from south
to west. The boy in the temple saw them in
their swift boat. He told Hiilei and prepared
for their coming. They landed, feasted, and told
their story. Then they prepared for their journey
to Waipio. Their boat was pulled by fish
in place of boatmen, and these disappeared upon
arrival at Hawaii. Ke-au-kai went first to meet
Olopana, who ran down to see Ke-au-nini and
asked how he came. Ke-au-nini said, "There
was no wandering, no murmuring, no hunger, no
pinched faces."</p>

<p>Then they feasted while over them thunder
and lightning played and mist covered the house.
Awa was thrown before the spirit of the thunder
and they established tabus.</p>

<p>Olopana had trouble with his priests and
became angry and wanted to punish them because
they did not know how to do their work
so well as Ke-au-nini. They could make thunder
and lightnings and earthquakes, but Ke-au-nini
blew toward the east and something like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
man appeared in a cloud of dust; he put his right
hand in the dust and began to make land. Olopana
saw this and thought it was done by the
kahunas (priests) and so he forgave them, thinking
they had more power than Ke-au-nini.
Later he ordered them to be killed and cooked.
Olopana asked Ke-au-nini, "Which of the tabu
houses do you wish to take as your residence?"
Ke-au-nini replied: "My house is the lightning,
the bloody sky, or the dark cloud hanging over
Kuai-he-lani, down the ridge or extending cape
Ke-au-oku, where Ku of Kauhika is, where multitudes
of eyes bend low before the gods. The
house of my parents&mdash;there is where I dwell.
You have heard of that place."</p>

<p>Olopana was greatly astonished, bowed his
head and thought for a long time, then said: "We
will set apart our tabu days for worship, and I
will see your tabu place&mdash;you in your place and
I outside. When you are through your days of
tabu you must return and we will live together."</p>

<p>Ke-au-nini raised his eyes and spoke softly to
the clouds above him: "O my parents, this my
brother-in-law wishes to see our dwelling-place,
therefore call Ke-au-kai to send down our tabu
dwelling-place."</p>

<p>Ke-au-kai was near him, and said: "We had
very many troubles on the ocean in coming after
the one whom you want for your wife. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
aided us to escape; perhaps the old man in the
skies will hear you if you call." Then Ke-au-nini
turned toward the east:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Ke-au-nini has his home,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;His home with his mother.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Hiilei, the wife,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;She was the child of Nakula-uka,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The first-born Kakela.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The cheeks grow red;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And the eyes flash fire.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;In the Lewa-lani (heavens),<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The very heart of the lightning,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;A double rainbow is high arched.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the Kana-mu are heard.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Calling and crying are the Kana-wa.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;[The Kana-mu and the Kana-wa were companies of little people, <i>i.e.</i>, fairies.]<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I continually call to you, O little ones,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Come here with the white feathers,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let feathers come here together;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let all the colors of the tortoise-back<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Gather and descend;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let all the posts stand strong;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Braced shall be the house;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Fasten in also the smoke-colored feathers;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Work swiftly and complete our tabu house."<br />
</p>

<p>Then the darkness of evening came, and in the
shadows the little people labored in the moonless
night. Soon their work was done, the house
finished, and a sacred drum placed inside. When
the clear sky of the morning rested over, and the
sun made visible the fairy home in the early
dawn, the people cried out with wonder at the
beautiful thing before them. There stood a
house of glowing feathers of all colors. Posts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and rafters of polished bones shone like the ivory
teeth of the whale, tinted in the smoke of a fire.
Softly swayed the feathered thatch in a gentle
breeze, rustling through the surrounding cocoa-trees.
Most beautiful it was, as in the chant of
Lilinoe:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Hulei Lilinoe me Kuka-hua-ula;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Hele Hoaheo i kai o Mokuleia."<br />
<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Lifted up, blown by the wind are<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The falls down to the sea of Mokuleia."<br />
</p>

<p>Ke-au-nini told his brother-in-law, "Oh, my
brother, look upon my tabu dwelling-place as
you wished."</p>

<p>Olopana was very curious, and asked, "How
many people are needed to make a house like
this so quickly?" Ke-au-nini laughed and said,
"You have seen my people: there are three of
us who built this house&mdash;I, the chief, and my
two friends."</p>

<p>He did not give the names of the little people,
Kana-mu and Kana-wa, who were really great
multitudes, like the menehunes who made the
ditch at Waimea, Kauai. They were the one-night
people. All this work was finished while
they alone could see clearly to use their magic
powers.</p>

<p>Inside the house lay soft mats made from feathers
of many birds, and sleeping-couches better
than had ever been seen before. Ke-au-nini
said to his brother-in-law: "We are now ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to have the tabu of our house. My parents will
enter with me."</p>

<p>Olopana asked his kahunas if it were right for
the parents to stay with the chief during a tabu,
under the law of their land. The priests consulted
and told Olopana that this was all right.
They had no power to forbid. The parents had
divine power, so also the boy, both alike, and
could dwell together without breaking tabu.
Then they said, "If you forbid, you will be landless."</p>

<p>Ke-au-kai and Ke-au-miki entered the house
with their young chief. Ke-au-miki beat the
sacred drum, announcing the tabu. They poured
and drank awa, ate sugar-cane and chanted softly
to the rhythm of the drum. Olopana was filled
with jealousy because all was hidden from him.
He did not know what a drum was. He had only
known a time of tabu, but not the secret drum,
and the soft chant.</p>

<p>During the ten days' tabu Ke-au-nini did not
see his wife, but remained shut in his place. Olopana
called for all the people to bring presents.
When the tabu was over and the temple door
opened, Ke-au-nini and Haina-kolo prepared for
the marriage.</p>

<p>All the people came bringing feather mats,
food, fish, and awa, which had been growing on
a tree. Hamakua sent food and fish; Hilo sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
olona and feathers; Puna sent mats and awa
from the trees; Kau sent kapa; Kona sent red
kapas; Kohala sent its wonderful noted sweet
potatoes. The young chiefess appeared before all
the people, coming from her tabu place, and she
saw all the fine presents, and a great cocoanut-leaf
lanai (porch) prepared by her brother. She
came there before her parents and brother. They
were waiting for Ke-au-nini, who delayed coming.
Olopana asked his priests: "Why does the
young chief fail to appear? We are all ready for
the marriage feast." The priest said to Olopana:
"Do you think that you can treat this man as
one of us? He is a god on his father's side and
also on his mother's. He is very high. It is
on his mother's side that you are related. You
should go to him with a sacrifice. Take a black
pig, a cup of awa, a black chicken, and a cocoanut.
If we do not do these things we shall not
know where he is staying, for he is under the
care of the gods. Now is the right time to go
with the offering. Go quickly. The sun is rising
high in the sky."</p>

<p>Olopana quickly gathered the offerings and
went away to sacrifice before Ke-au-nini. He
called him thus:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Rise up! Let your strength look inland;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let your might look toward the sea;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let your face look upward;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Look up to the sun over your head;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The strange night has passed. Awake!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the offerings,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Food for the gods:<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let life come!"<br />
</p>

<p>He set the pig free and it ran to the feet of
Ke-au-nini. The chicken did the same, and the
other offerings were laid before the door. Olopana
went back. Ke-au-nini and his uncles
awoke. He said to them: "Now the tabu is
lifted. Now the hour of the marriage has come.
We must prepare to go down to the sea. We
shall see the sports of this land. Soon we shall
meet the priests and the people."</p>

<p>They arose and opened their bundles of kapa,
very fine and soft for red malos (girdles) for the
uncles. Ke-au-nini put on his malo, called
Ke-kea-awe-awe-ula (the red girdle with long
ends, shaded in the tints of the rainbow) and
his red feather cloak and his red feather helmet,
nodding like a bird. His skin, polished and
perfumed, shone resplendently. He was most
gorgeous in his appearance.</p>

<p>When he went out of his house, thatched with
bird feathers and built of polished bones, darkness
spread over the sky. The voices of the
little fairies, the Kana-mu and Kana-wa were
heard. The people in the great cocoanut lanai
were filled with wonder, for they had never seen
darkness come in this way. It was like the sun
eclipsed. When Ke-au-nini and his companions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>entered the lanai, the darkness passed away and
all the people saw them in their splendor. The
chiefs opened a way for the three. Ke-au-miki
came in first and the people thought he was the
husband, but when Ke-au-kai came they said,
"This one is more beautiful," and when Ke-au-nini
passed before them they fell on their faces,
although he had a gauze kapa thrown over him.
He passed on between rows of chiefs to the
place of marriage. His uncles stepped aside, and
then he threw off his thin kapa and the people
shouted again and again until the echoes shook
the precipices around the valley.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 354px;">
<img src="images/218.jpg" width="354" height="600" alt="A YOUNG CHIEF OF HAWAII" title="" />
<span class="caption">A YOUNG CHIEF OF HAWAII</span>
</div>

<p>Then Haina-kolo came out of her house near
by and was guided to the side of her husband.
As she saw him her heart melted and flowed to
him like the mingling of floating sea-mosses.
Olopana arose and said: "O chiefs and people,
I have been asked to come here to the marriage
of my sister with one whom she has met in dreams
and loved. I agree to this wedding. Our parents
approve, and the gods have given their signs.
Our chiefess shall belong to the stranger. You
shall obey him. I will do as he may direct.
They shall now become husband and wife."</p>

<p>The people shouted again and again, saying,
"This is the husband of our chiefess." Then
began the hookupu. Six districts brought six
piles of offerings. There were treasures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
treasures of all kinds. Then came the wonderful
feast of all the people.</p>

<p>The fish companions of Ke-au-nini, who had
drawn his boat from Kuai-he-lani, wanted Haina-kolo
for themselves. While they were at the
feast they found they could not get her, and they
grew cold and ashamed and angry. Soon they
broke away from the feast. Moi and Uhu ran
away to the sea and returned to their homes.
Niu-loa-hiki (a great eel) looked at Ke-au-nini
and said: "You are very strange. I thought
I should have my reward this day, but the winning
has come to you. I am angry, because you
are my servant. It is a shame for the chiefs of
Hawaii to let you become their ruler." His
angry eyes flashed fire, he opened his mouth and
started to cry out again, but the people saw him
and shouted: "Look, look, there is an eel that
comes to the land. He runs and dives into the
sea. This eel, Niu-loa-hiki, is more evil than
any other of all the family of eels."</p>

<p>Then all the fish ran off angry at this failure
and gathered in the sea for consultation. Uhu
said he would return at once to Makapuu. He
was the Uhu who had the great battle with
Kawelo when he was caught in a net. Moi went
to the rough water outside the harbor. Kumunuiaiake
went to Hilo. He was the huge fish
with which Limaloa had a great battle when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
came to visit Hawaii. He was killed by Limaloa.
Hou and Awela went wherever they could find
a ditch to swim in.</p>

<p>The people feasted on the mullet of Lolakea
and the baked dogs of Hilo and the humpbacked
mullet of Waiakea and all the sweet things of
Hawaii. Then the sports commenced and there
was surf-riding, dancing, wrestling, and boxing.</p>

<p>Kawelo-hea, the surf-rider of Kawa
in Oahu,
was the best surf-rider. Hina-kahua, the child
of the battling-places of Kohala, was the best
boxer. Pilau-hulu, the noted boy of Olaa, was
the best puhenehene-player. Lilinoe was the
best konane-player. Luu-kia was the best kilu-player.
She was a relative of Haina-kolo.</p>

<p>When the sports were over they returned to
the chief's house and slept. Haina-kolo was one
who did not closely adhere to the tabu. She ate
the tabu things, which were sacred, belonging to
the gods, such as bananas and luau. Ke-au-nini
had always carefully, from his birth to marriage-day,
observed the tabu, but, following the example
of his wife, soon laid aside his carefulness, and
lived in full disregard of all restraint for a time.</p>

<p>Then Ke-au-nini left Haina-kolo and returned
to Kuai-he-lani because dissensions arose between
them on account of their wrong-doing.</p>

<p>He did not tell his wife or friends, or even his
uncles, but he took his cocoanut-boat to go back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to his home secretly. When he was far out in
the ocean his sister saw him from her home in
Lewa-lani (the blue sky). She sent Kana-ula,
her watchman, to go out and guard him and bring
him to her. Kana-ula was a strong wind blowing
with the black clouds which rise before a storm.</p>

<p>In a little while the watchman saw Ke-au-nini
off Kohala, and by his great strength lifted Ke-au-nini
and placed him on Kuai-he-lani, where he
saw his mother and relatives. Then he went up
to Lewa-lani to his sister and dwelt with her to
forget his love for Haina-kolo.</p>

<p>Haina-kolo had a great love for her husband,
never making any trouble before they separated.
Her love for him was burning and full of passion,
while she grieved over his disappearance. She
soon had a child. The priests living in the heiau
(temple), Pakaalana, beat their drums, and all
Waipio knew that a chief was born.</p>

<p>Haina-kolo began to go about like one crazed,
longing to see the eyes of her husband. She took
her child and launched out in the ocean. The
boat in which she placed the child was the long
husk of a cocoanut. She held fast to this and
swam and floated by its side. When they had
gone far out in the sea a great wind swept over
them and upon them, driving them far out of
sight of all land. She looked only for death.
This wind was Kana-ula, and had been sent by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Moho, who was very angry at the girl for violating
the tabu of the gods and eating the things
set apart for the gods. This wind was to blow
her far away on the ocean until death came.</p>

<p>When Haina-kolo had been blown a little way
she prayed and moved her feet, turning toward
the place where she had rejoiced with her husband.
Then she offered another prayer and
began to swim, but was driven out of sight of
land. The wind ceased, its anger passed away,
and a new land appeared. She swam toward
this new land. Lei-makani, the child, saw this
land, which was the high place of Ke-ao-lewa,
and chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Destroy the first kou grove;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy the second kou grove;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Open a wonderful door in the evening;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Offer your worship.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Return, return, O bird!"<br />
</p>

<p>The mother said: "No, my child, that is not a
bird. Oh, my child, that is Ke-ao-lewa, the
land where we shall find a shore."</p>

<p>But she went on patiently, swimming by the
capes of Kohala, and came near to the places of
noted surf and was almost on the land. Moho
saw her still swimming and sent another wind
servant, Makani-kona, the south wind, to drive
her again out in the ocean. This south wind
came like a whirlwind, sweeping and twisting
over the waves, sending Haina-kolo far out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the tossing sea. He thought he had killed her,
so he went back to Moho.</p>

<p>Moho asked him about his journey over the
seas. He replied, "You sent me to kill, and that
I did." She was satisfied and ceased her vigilance.
Tired and suffering, Haina-kolo and her
child floated far out in the ocean, too weary to
swim. Then Lei-makani saw Ke-ao-lewa again
lifted up and spread out like the wings of a floating
bird. Help came to her in a great shark,
Kau-naha-ili-pakapaka (Kau-naha, with a rough
skin), belonging to the family of Pii-moi, one of
the relatives of Ku, who swam up to her and
carried her and the child until he was tired.
Haina-kolo was rested and warmed by the sun.
She saw that her shark friend was growing weak,
so she called to the sun, "O sun, go on your way
to the land of Ka-lewa-nuu, and tell Ke-au-nini
that we are here at the cape of Ka-ia."</p>

<p>The sun did not hear the cry from the sea.
She called again, using the same words. The sun
heard this call of Haina-kolo and went on to the
place where Ke-au-nini was staying and called
to him, "O Ke-au-nini, your wife is near the
cape of Ka-ia."</p>

<p>Moho heard the call. She was playing konane
with her brother. She made a noise to confuse
the words of the sun, and said to her brother,
"O ke ku kela, o ka holo keia. Niole ka luna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
kopala ka ele, na ke kea ka ai." "Take this one
up. Let that one move. Take that up slowly.
The black is blotted out, the white wins."</p>

<p>Then the sun called again, saying the same
words, and Ke-au-nini heard, leaped up and left
his sister, and went down to Kuai-he-lani and
entered the temple, where he was accustomed to
sleep, and fell as one dead. While he was reclining,
his spirit left his body and went down to
Milu and stayed there a long time.</p>

<p>Haina-kolo was very near the land in the
afternoon. Soon they came to the beach. There
she dug a little hole for her child and laid him in
his little boat in it and went up the path like a
crazy person to the top of the high precipices of
Ka-hula-anu (the cold dancing) and began to
eat fruit growing on the trees. She clothed herself
in leaves, then rushed into the forest.</p>

<p>Lei-makani was still floating where his mother
had left him, near a place where the servants of
Luu-kia went fishing every morning to get the
food loved by the chiefs. Two men, Ka-holo-holo-uka
and Ka-holo-holo-kai, had come down
for Luu-kia, carrying a net. They threw their
net over the water and the child floated into it.
They thought they had a great fish. They
carried the net up on the beach and found the
boy. It was a little dark, and hard to see what
they were catching. One called to the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
"What have we caught this morning?" The
other said: "I thought we had a great fish, but
this is a child. I will take this child to my
home." The other said, "No&mdash;This is a fish."
So they had a quarrel until the sun rose. Then
they went up to the village.</p>

<p>Ka-holo-holo-uka told his wife, "We have a
child." Then he told her how they had caught
Lei-makani. They talked loudly. This chiefess
heard their noisy clamor and asked her servant,
"What's the trouble with these noisy ones?"
They told her and she wanted that child brought
to her, and commanded Maile-lau-lii (small leaf
maile) to go and get it. He took it to Luu-kia,
who marked its wonderful beauty. She sent
for the fishermen to tell her how they got the
child. They told her about the fishing.</p>

<p>She wanted to know who were the parents.
They said: "We do not know. This may be the
child of Haina-kolo, for we know she has disappeared
with her child. She may be dead and
this may be her boy."</p>

<p>Luu-kia said, "You two take the child, and I
will give the name, Lopa-iki-hele-wale [going
without anything]. Then you care for it until
it grows up."</p>

<p>They took the child to the land of Opaeloa, as
a good place to bring it up. The fishermen said
to Luu-kia, "Will you provide food, fish, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
clothing?" She said, "Yes." They thought the
child would not understand, but it knew all these
words. The fisherman and his wife took the
child away. Waipio Valley people were surrounded
by precipices, but the gods of Waipio
watched all the troubles by sending messengers
to go over to the upland and follow Haina-kolo.</p>

<p>Ku and Hina and Olopana were burdened by
the loss of Haina-kolo and Lei-makani, so they
went to the temple at Pakaalana, where the
uncles of Ke-au-nini were staying. There they
consulted the gods with signs and sorceries.</p>

<p>They sent Ke-au-miki to get some little
stones at Kea-au, a place near Haena. His
brother said: "Get thirteen stones&mdash;seven white
and six black. Make them fast in a bundle, so
they cannot be lost, then come back by Pana-ewa
and get awa (<i>piper methysticum</i>) which man
did not plant, but which was carried by the birds
to the trees and planted there. Then return
this evening and we will study the signs." Ke-au-miki
went up the pali (precipice) and hastened
along the top running and leaping and
flying over Hamakua to Hilo.</p>

<p>The Hilo palis were nothing to this man as
he sped swiftly over the gulches until he came
to the Wailuku River guarded by the kupua
Pili-a-mo-o, who concealed the path so that none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
could find it until a price was paid. The dragon
covered the path with its rough skin.</p>

<p>Ke-au-miki stood looking for a path, but could
only see what seemed to be pahoehoe lava. The
tail of the dragon was like a kukui-tree-trunk
lying in the water. He saw the tail switching
and rising up to strike him. Then he knew that
this was a kupua. The tail almost struck him
on the head. He called to Kahuli in Kuai-he-lani,
who sent a mighty wind and hurled aside the
waters, caught up the body of the dragon and
let it fall, smashing it on the rocks, breaking the
beds of lava.</p>

<p>Then Ke-au-miki rushed over the river and up
the precipices, speeding along to Pa-ai-ie, where
the long ohia point of Pana-ewa is found, then
turned toward the sea and went to Haena, to
the place where the little stones aala-manu are
found. He picked up the stones and ran to
Pana-ewa and got the awa hanging on the tree,
tied up the awa and stones and hurried back.
He crossed the gulch at Konolii and met a man,
Lolo-ka-eha, who tried to take the awa away
from him. He was a robber. When they came
face to face, Ke-au-miki caught the man with
his hand, hurled him over the precipice and killed
him. When he saw that this man was dead, he
ran as swiftly as the wind until he met a very
beautiful woman, Wai-puna-lei. She saw him
and asked him to be her husband, but he would
not stop. He crossed Hilo boundaries to Hamakua,
to the place where the kapa-trees were growing,
as the sun was going down over the palis.
He came to the temple door and laid down his
burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>Then Ke-au-kai said: "This is my word to all
the people: Prepare the awa while I take the
little stones, pour awa into a cup: I will cover it
up and we will watch the signs. If, while I
chant, the bubbles on the awa come to the left
side, we will find Haina-kolo. If they go to the
right, she is fully lost. Let all the people keep
silence; no noise, no running about, no sleeping.
Watch all the signs and the clouds in the
heavens."</p>

<p>Then he chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O Ku and Kane and Kanaloa,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let the magic power come.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Amama ua noa.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Tabu is lifted from<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My bird-catching place for food.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;You are a stranger, I am a resident.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let the friend be taken care of.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;United is the earth of the tabu woman. Amama."<br />
</p>

<p>The bubbles stood on the right side, and the
priest said, "We shall never find Haina-kolo;
the gods have gone away." Olopana said: "I
am much troubled for my brother and sister, and
that child I wanted for the chief of this land. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
do not understand why these things have come
to us."</p>

<p>All the people were silent, weeping softly, but
Ke-au-kai and his brother were not troubled, for
they knew their chief and wife were in the care
of the aumakuas.</p>

<p>When Lei-makani had grown up, Luu-kia took
him as her husband. He went surf-riding daily.
She was very jealous of Maile, who would often
go surf-riding with him. Lei-makani did not
care for her, for he knew she was a sister of his
mother although she had a child by him. One
day, when he went with Maile, Luu-kia was
angry and caught that child and killed it by
dashing it against a stone.</p>

<p>The servants went down to the beach, waiting
for Lei-makani to come to land. Then they told
him about the death of his child and their fear
for him if he went up to the house with Maile.
Lei-makani left his surf-board and went to the
house weeping, and found the child's body by
the stone. He took a piece of kapa and wrapped
it up, carrying the broken body down to a fountain,
where he cleansed it and offered chants and
incantations until the child became alive. His
mother, Haina-kolo, heard the following chants
and came to her son, for the voice was carried to
her by kupuas who had magic powers. The
child's name was Lono-kai. He wrapped it again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in soft warm kapas and chanted while he washed
the child, naming the fountain Kama-ahala (a
child has passed away):</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Kama-ahala smells of the blood;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The sick smell of the blood rises.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Washed away in the earth is the blood;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Hard is the red blood<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Warmed by the heat of the heavens,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Laid out under the shining sky.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Lono-kai-o-lohia is dead."<br />
</p>

<p>Then the voice of the child was heard in a low
moan from the bundle, saying, "Lono-kai-o-lohia
[Lono possessed of the Ala spirit] is alive."
The father heard the voice and softly uttered
another chant:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"In the silence<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Has been heard the gods of the night;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;What is this wailing over us?<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Wailing for the death of<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Lono, the spirit of the sea&mdash;dead!"<br />
</p>

<p>The voice came again from the kapas, "Lono,
the spirit of the sea, is alive." Lei-makani's
love for his child was overflowing, and again he
uttered an incantation to his own parents:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O Ku, the father!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Hina, the mother!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Olopana was the first-born;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Haina-kolo, the sister, was born:<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Haina-kolo and Ke-au-nini were the parents:<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Lei-makani was the child:<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I am Lei-makani, the child of Haina-kolo,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred woman of Waipio's precipices;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My mother is living among the ripe halas;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>For us was the fruit of the ulii;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I was found by the fisherman;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I am the child of the pali hula-anu;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I was cared for by one of my family<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Inland at Opaeloa;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;They gave me the name Lopa-iki-hele-wale<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;[Little lazy fellow having nothing];<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;But I am Lei-makani&mdash;you shall hear it."<br />
</p>

<p>His heart was heavy with longing for his
mother, and the gods of the wind, the wind
brothers, took his plaintive love-chant to the
ears of Haina-kolo, who had wandered in her
insanity, but was now free from her craze and
had become herself. She followed that voice
over the precipices and valleys to the top of a
precipice. Standing there and looking down she
saw her child and grandchild below, and she
chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Thy voice I have heard<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Softly echoed by the pali,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Wailing against the pali;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy voice, my child beloved;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My child, indeed;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My child, when the cloud hung over<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And the rainbow light was above us,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;That day when we floated together<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;When the sea was breaking my heart;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My child of the cape of Ka-ia,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun was hanging above us.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Where have I been?<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Tell Ke-au-nini-ula-o-ka-lani;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I was in the midst of the sea<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;With the child of our love;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My child, my little child,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Where are you? Oh, come back!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she went down the precipice and met
her son holding his child in his arms, and wailed:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"My lord from the fogs of the inland,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From the precipices fighting the wind,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Striking down along the ridges;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My child, with the voice of a bird,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Echoed by the precipice of Pakohi,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking and dancing on inaccessible places,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing out on the broken waters<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Where we were floating in danger;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;There I loved dearly your voice<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting with waves<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;While the fierce storm was above us<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Seen by your many gods<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Who dwell in the shining sky&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Auwe for us both!"<br />
</p>

<p>They waited a little while, until the time when
Lono-kai became strong again. Then they went
up to the village.</p>

<p>Haina-kolo had run into the forest, her wet
pa-u torn off, no clothing left. Her long hair
was her cloak, clothing her from head to foot.
She wandered until cold, then dressed herself
with leaves. As her right senses returned she
made warm garments of leaves and ate fruits of
the forest. When they came to the village they
met the people who knew Haina-kolo. She
dwelt there until Lono-kai grew up. He and
his father looked like twins, having great resemblance,
people told them, to Ke-au-nini. The boy
asked, "Where is my grandfather, Ke-au-nini?"
Lei-makani said: "I never saw your grandfather.
He was very tabu and sacred. He killed his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
father, Ku-aha-ilo, god of the heavens. I know
by my mana [spirit power] that he is with the
daughters of Milu." The boy said: "I must go
and find him. I will go in my spirit body, leaving
this human body. You must not forbid the
journey." Ke-au-kai, the priest, said: "You cannot
find him unless you learn what to do before
you go. Those chiefs of Milu have many sports
and games. I tell you these things must be
learned before you go into that land. If you
are able to win against the spirits of that place
you can get your grandfather."</p>

<p>All the chiefs aided the boy to acquire skill in
all sports. They went to the fields of Paaohau.
Nuanua, the most skilful teacher of hula, taught
him to dance. The highest chiefs and chiefesses
went with him to help, taking their retinues with
them. Lei-makani said: "The knowledge of
sports is the means by which you will catch your
grandfather. Now be careful. Do not be stingy
with food. Give to others and take care of the
people."</p>

<p>They went up in a great company, and Haina-kolo
wondered at the beauty of the boy, and asked
why they were travelling. Lono-kai told them
the reason for his journey and desire to see the
field of sports.</p>

<p>Nuanua, the hula teacher, sent his assistants
to get all kinds of leaves and flowers used in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
hula, then sent for a black pig to be used as
an omen. If it ran to Lono-kai, he would become
a good dancer; if not, he would fail. The
pig went to him. The priest offered this prayer:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Laka is living where the forest leaves are trembling,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost-god of dancers above and below,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From the boundary of the North to the place most southern;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Laka, your altar is covered with leaves,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The dancing leaves of the ieie vine;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;This offering of leaves is the labor of the gods,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The gods of your family, Pele and Hiiaka;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The women living in warm winds come here for the toil,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And this labor of ours is learning your dance.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Tabu laid down; tabu lifted. Amama ua noa [We are through]!"<br />
</p>

<p>The priest lifted his eyes, and the pig was seen
lying at the foot of the boy. Then he commenced
teaching the boy the kilu and the first dance.
They were thirty days learning the dances, and
the boy learned all those his teachers knew.</p>

<p>Then they went around Hawaii, studying the
dances. He was told to go back and get all the
new ideas and seek the gods to learn their newest
dance, for theirs differed from those of his teachers.
He was to seek this knowledge in dreams.
Lei-makani said: "Your teachers have shown
you the slow way; if that is all you know, you
will win fame, but not victory. You must learn
from the gods." Lono-kai again went to Hamakua
with his companions and learned how to play
konane, the favorite game of Ke-au-nini. The
teacher said, "I have taught you all I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
inside and outside, as I would not teach the
other young chiefs." The boy said to him,
"There is one thing more,&mdash;give offerings to the
gods that they may teach us in our dreams
newer and better ways."</p>

<p>So they waited quietly, offering sacrifices. The
priests told him to set apart a pig while he made
a prayer. If the pig died during the prayer, he
would not forget anything learned. The boy
laid his right hand on the pig and began to pray:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Here is a pig, an offering to the gods.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Lono in the Under-world, Lono in the sky:<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Kane, who makes not-to-be-broken laws,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Kane in the darkness, Kane in the hot wind,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Kane of the generations, Kane of the thunder,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Kane in the whirlwind and the storm:<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Here is labor&mdash;labor of the gods.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My body is alive for you!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Filled up is the Nuu-pule.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;My prayer is for those you hold dear.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Laka, come with knowledge and magic power!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Laka, dancing in the moving forest leaves<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Of the mountain ridges and the valleys,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Return and bestow the knowledge<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Of Pele and Hiiaka, the guardians of the wind,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the multitude of the gods of the night,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing Aukele-nui-aku in the Under-world.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O people of the night,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the pig, the offering!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Come with knowledge, magic power, and safety.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Amama ua noa."<br />
</p>

<p>Then the boy lifted his hand and the pig lay silent
in death. Then came thunder shaking the earth,
and lightning flashing in flames, and a storm
breaking in red rain. Mists came and the shad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>ows
of the thousands of gods of Ke-au-nini fell
upon the boy. The teachers and friends sat in
perfect silence for a long time. The storm was
beating outside, and the boy was overcome with
weariness and wondered at the silence of his
friends.</p>

<p>Rainbow colors were about him, and the people
were awed by their fears and sat still until evening
came. Then the teacher asked the boy if
he saw what had been done in the darkness resting
over him, and if he could explain to them.
The boy said, "I do not understand you; perhaps
my teacher can explain."</p>

<p>Nuanua said: "I am growing old and have
never seen such things above any one learning
the dance. You have come to me modestly, like
one of the common people, when I should have
gone to you, and now the gods show your worth
and power and their favor."</p>

<p>Then he took a piece of wood from the hula
altar which was covered with leaves and flowers,
and, putting it in a cup of awa, shook it, and
looked, and said to the boy: "This is the best I
can do for you. Now the gods will take you in
their care." Then he poured awa into cups,
passing them to all the people as he chanted
incantations, all the company clapping their
hands. Then they drank. But the boy's cup
was drunk by the eepas of Po (gnomes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
night). So the company feasted and the night
became calm. Lono-kai that night left his
friends with Nuanua and journeyed on. He
waited some days and then told Lei-makani he
thought he was ready. He said: "Yes, I have
heard about your success, but I will see what
you can do. We will wait another ten days
before you go." Then for two days all the people
of Waipio brought their offerings. They built
a great lanai, and feasted. Lei-makani told the
people that he had called them together to see
the wonderful power in the sports of the boy.
So the boy stood up and chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O Kuamu-amu [the little people of the clouds of the sky],<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The alii thronging in crowds from Kuai-he-lani,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;On the shoulders of Moana-liha, divided at the waters,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Divided at the waters of the heavy mist,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And the rain coming from the skies,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And the storm rushing inland.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Broken into mists are the falls of the mountains,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Mists that bathe the buds of the flowers,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the buds below the precipices.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, O beloved one!"<br />
</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p><p>Ke-au-nini heard this chant, even down in Po,
while he was sporting with the eepas of Milu,
while his spirit body was with his friend Popo-alaea.
He repeated the same chant, and the
ghosts all rejoiced and laughed, and Laka leaped
to his side and danced before him. They had
the same sports as the noted ones on Hawaii.
Lono-kai danced in magic power before all the
people until the time came for him to go along
the path of his visions of the night. All omens
and signs had been noted and were found to be
favorable. One of the old priests told the people
to make known their thought about the best
path for the young chief, but they were silent.
Then Moli-lele, an old priest who had the spirit
of the unihipilis resting upon him, said: "I know
that there will be many troubles. Cold and
fierce winds come over the sea. Low tides come
in the morning. The land of Kane-huna-moku
rises in the coral surf." He chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Dead is this chief of ours,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Caught as a bird strikes a fish;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The foam of surf waves rises up,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Smiting and driving below.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;No sorcerer of the land is there,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Where the coral reef labors,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And the rock-eating Hina of the far-off sea."<br />
</p>

<p>The chiefs began to wail, but lightning was in
the eyes of the boy and his face was filled with
anger at this word of the old priest. Then
another priest arose and said: "O chiefs and
people, I have seen the path to the Under-world,
and it is not right for this young man to go. His
body is human and easily captured by the ghosts.
He might be safe if he could get the body of the
one he seeks. There are fierce guardians of the
path who will make war on whoever comes in
the flesh."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Kalei, another priest, said: "I know their
world. I saw the stars this morning, and they
told me that the path was stopped against this
chief by broken coral and the bones of the dead.
The tabu-children of Hina are swimming in the
sea. I will prove the danger by this awa cup.
If the bubbles of the awa poured in go to the
right, he can go. If to the left, he must stay."
This he did uttering incantations, but bubbles
covered all the surface.</p>

<p>Then the priests advised the young chief to
stay and eat the fat of the land. Then Hae-hae,
the great chief, said, "We have come to point out
a path, if we can, and to make quiet and peaceful
that way into Po." He instituted new omens,
and showed that the young chief would be successful,
but he would have many difficulties to
overcome.</p>

<p>Lono-kai arose and said: "The words of these
chiefs were twisted. I will go after the spirit-body
of my grandfather, as I have sworn to do.
My word is fast. I will go to the land where my
grandfather stays."</p>

<p>The priests who had tried to terrify Lono-kai
were his enemies, and would oppose his journey,
and he wanted them killed, but Lei-makani would
not permit it. Ku also quieted him with patient
words, and he ceased from anger and told them
he must prepare at once to go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Lei-makani had a double canoe made ready,
and selected a number of strong men to accompany
the young chief. Lono-kai would not have
any of these men, but went out early in the morning,
took a cup of awa to the temple nearby and
chanted his genealogical mele.</p>

<p>Thunder and lightning and heavy wind and
rain attended his visit to the temple. He returned
to his parents and told them to wait for
him thirty days. If a mist was over all the land
they might wait and watch ten days more, and
if the mist continued, another ten, when he would
return with thunder and lightning to meet his
friends. But if the voices of the sea were strong
at Kumukahi, with mist resting on Opaelolo
and rain on Puu-o-ka-polei, then he would be
dead.</p>

<p>He took his feather cloak and war weapons
from his grandparents, and feather helmet, and
went out. He bade his parents farewell, took a
cocoanut-husk canoe and went down to the sea.
The waves rose high, pounding the face of the
coast precipices. Lei-makani ran down to bring
Lono-kai back, but according to the proverb he
caught the hand of the chiefess who lives in the
land of Nowhere. The boy had disappeared.</p>

<p>Out in the sea Lono-kai was tossing in the
high waves, passing all the islands, even to the
land Niihau. There he met the great watchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of Kuai-he-lani called Honu (the turtle). He
came quietly near the head. Honu asked,
"Where are you going?" Lono-kai said: "You
speak as if you alone had the right to the sea.
You are a humpbacked turtle; you shall become
a great round stone." Then the turtle began
to slap its fins on the sea, raising waves high as
precipices. Five times forty he struck the sea
with mighty force, looking for the destruction of
the chief as the waves passed over him. But
Lono-kai waited until the turtle became tired,
thinking the chief dead. As the waters became
calm the chief raised his club and struck the
right flapper of the turtle, destroying its power.</p>

<p>Then the left fin beat the sea into foam, but
Lono-kai waited and broke that fin also; then he
broke the back of the turtle into little pieces and
went on his way. Soon the ocean grew fierce
again. Huge waves came, and whirlwinds. He
saw something red in the great sea&mdash;a kupua
of the ocean. The name of this enemy was Ea,
a great red turtle, who crawled out and asked
where he was going. Lono-kai said: "What
right have you to question me? Have I questioned
your right to go on the sea?"</p>

<p>Ea said: "This is not your place. I will kill
you. You shall be food for me to eat. When
you are dead I will go and kill the watchman who
let you come into this tabu-sea of my chief."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>"Who is your chief?" asked Lono-kai. Ea replied:
"Hina-kekai [the calabash for boiling water],
the daughter of Pii-moi. Now I will kill you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/248.jpg" width="600" height="493" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then Ea began to strike the water with his
right fin, throwing the water up on all sides in
mighty waves, expecting to overthrow Lono-kai
and his boat. When he rested to see the result
of this battle his fin was on the surface, and the
chief struck it and broke it.</p>

<p>Then in another fight, when head and fin were
lifted to destroy the boat, Lono-kai struck the
neck and broke it, so killing his enemy.</p>

<p>Now he thought all his troubles were over and
he could go safely on his way.</p>

<p>But soon there lay before him a new enemy,
floating on the sea, a very long thing, like a long
stick. He approached and saw that it was like
the fin of a shark, but as he came nearer he observed
the smooth skin of a long eel. Lifting
its head and looking right at him, the eel said:
"O, proud man, you are here where you have
no business to be. I will mix you with my awa
and eat you now." Then he struck at Lono-kai
with his tail and hit his eyes and knocked
him down, then, thinking Lono-kai was dead,
he turned his head to the boat to catch the body,
but Lono-kai, leaping up on the head of the eel,
holding his boat with one hand and his club with
the other, struck the head with the magic club,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
breaking the bones. Fire came out of the broken
head, the eel falling into pieces which became
islands of fire in the midst of which appeared a
very beautiful woman who asked him whence he
came, and why.</p>

<p>He told her he was from Hawaii and was going
to Kuai-he-lani and would kill her, for he thought
she was a mo-o, or dragon-woman. He said,
"You tried to kill me, O woman, and now
you must stay and become the fire oven of the
ocean." He asked her name. She said to him:
"This kupua was Waka, the dragon of the rough
head, and I have escaped from his body. I want
you now for my husband, and I will accompany
you on your journey."</p>

<p>Lono-kai told her, "This would not be right,
but when I return, if I come this way, you shall
be mine." She said, "My ruler will kill me, for
I have been sent to guard this place." Lono-kai
asked, "Who is your ruler?" "Hina-kekai, she
will kill me. You belong to the Ku-aha-ilo family,
which is a very strong family. Therefore we
have been watching for you for our chiefess."</p>

<p>Lono-kai told her to go to his land and wait
for him. He would be her husband. She must
wait there without fault until his return. Then
he went away. Waka did not know whence this
chief came, so she went to Oahu and landed at
Laiewai. There she awaited her husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Lono-kai went on to the land of Kuai-he-lani,
where he landed and hid his boat among the
vines on the beach. He went to the temple where
the body of his grandfather lay, clean and beautiful
in death. He could not see any door or
break in the body for the escape of the spirit.</p>

<p>Then he struck the earth with his magic war-club
until a great hole opened. He looked down
and saw a large house and many people moving
around below. He knew that the spirit of his
grandfather was there. He went down and
looked about, but the people had disappeared.
The remains of a great feast were there. He
stood at the door looking in, when two men appeared
and welcomed him with an "Aloha," and
told him he must have come from the land above,
for there was no man like him in that place.
They advised him to make his path back into
that land from whence he had come, for if the
king of the Under-world saw him he would be
killed. Lono-kai asked, "Who is your king?"
They told him, "Milu." "What does he do?"
"Our king dances for Popo-alaea and Ke-au-nini."
Lono-kai went with the men to see the
sports. They tried to persuade him not to go,
but he was very obstinate and asked them to
hide him. They said, "If we do this and you
are discovered we shall be destroyed."</p>

<p>He told them the reason of his coming and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
asked their help, and said when he had his grandfather
they could follow him into the Upper-world.
They went to a house which was large
and beautiful. They entered and saw the chiefs
playing kilu. After a long time Lono-kai began
to make his presence known. Popo-alaea was
winning. Then Ke-au-nini chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"The multitude of those below give greeting<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;To the friends of the inland forest of Puna;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;We praise the restfulness of our home;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves and divine flowers of that place."<br />
</p>

<p>Lono-kai chanted the same words as an echo
of Ke-au-nini. Silence fell on the group, and
Milu cried out: "Who is the disturber of our
sport? We must find him and kill him." They
began the search, but could not find any one
and at last resumed their games. Popo-alaea
chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"I welcome back my friend,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The great shadow of Waimea,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Where stands the milo-tree in the gentle breeze,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And the ohia-tree. You know the place."<br />
</p>

<p>Ke-au-nini sang the same chant. Then Lono-kai
echoed it very softly and sweetly. All said
this last voice was the best. Milu again caused
a search to be made, but found nothing. The
two men hid Lono-kai by a post of the house.</p>

<p>The group returned to the sports. Soon Milu
changed the game to hula. Ke-au-nini stood up
to dance and began his chant:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Aloha to our houses without friends.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The path goes inland to Papalakamo;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Come now and enter!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Outside is the trouble, the storm,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And there you meet the cold."<br />
</p>

<p>The people around were striking the spirit
drums. Then Lono-kai chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Established is the honor of Ke-au-nini<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;(Noteworthy is the name).<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted up to the high heaven;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I am the child of Lei-makani,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I am Lono from the sunrise place, Hae-o-hae:<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;I have come after thee, my father;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;We must return. Where are you?"<br />
</p>

<p>Ke-au-nini could not stand up to dance when
he heard the voice of his grandchild, for his love
overpowered him. He looked up and saw the
form of the young chief leaping into the place
prepared for the hula and standing there before
the chief. The people rose up in great confusion.
Lono-kai caught the spirit of Ke-au-nini
and put it in a cocoanut-shell. He leaped past
the ghosts, and ran very swiftly out of the house.</p>

<p>Some of the people saw him lay hands on
Ke-au-nini, and cried out: "Oh, the husband of
our chiefess! Oh, the husband of our chiefess!
He has taken the husband of our chiefess!" But
they did not see Lono-kai go out. The two men
who had aided Lono-kai went out as soon as he
leaped into the hula place. They hurried along
the path toward freedom, but Lono-kai soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
overtook them. Milu called to his people to
hasten and capture and kill the one who had
stolen Ke-au-nini. They saw the two men with
Lono-kai, and pursued rapidly, but could not
overtake them. The fugitives were very near
the opening to the world above. When Lono-kai
saw that the pursuers were almost upon
him he whirled his magic war-club and struck
the ground, making a great hole into which the
spirits fell one over the other.</p>

<p>Lono-kai and the two watchmen went up the
cave opening by which he had gone down into
the land of Milu. Dawn was breaking as they
ran into the temple at Kuai-he-lani, where the
body of Ke-au-nini was lying. Lono-kai pushed
the spirit into the hollow of the foot and held the
foot fast, shaking it until the spirit had gone to
the very ends of the body and life had returned.</p>

<p>When Ke-au-nini was fully restored, Lono-kai
asked him if he could help restore to their bodies
the two spirits who had aided him in escaping.
Ke-au-nini evidently did not remember anything
of his life in the Under-world, for he did not know
these ghosts and thought he had been asleep
from the time he entered the temple and fell
down in weariness. Lono-kai thought they
could not find the bodies, but Ke-au-nini put
the ghosts in cocoanuts and carried them up
into the forest to one of his ancestors who knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the bodies from which these ghosts had come.
Thus they were restored and had a long and
happy life in their former home.</p>

<p>Lono-kai told his grandfather they must return
to Hawaii to meet all the friends.</p>

<p>For thirty days mists covered Hawaii and there
was thunder and lightning and earthquakes.
Then Lono-kai said to Ke-au-nini: "To-morrow
we must go to Hawaii. We must have the appropriate
ceremonies for cleansing and taking
food." Ke-au-nini said: "Yes, I have been a
long time in the adopted land of Milu, and my
eyes are dimmed and my thought is dazed with
the dance of the restless spirits of the night. We
must wait until I have performed all the cleansing
ceremonies, made offerings and incantations.
Prayers must be said for my return to life. Then
we will go."</p>

<p>They attended to all the temple rites, and the
marks of death were washed away. The body
was cleansed, the eyes made clear, so strength
and joy returned into the body. Then Ke-au-nini
said: "I am ready. I see a multitude of
birds circling around Kaula. There is evil
toward Hawaii."</p>

<p>They again went into the temple and slept
until very early the next morning. Then they
took their cocoanut-husk canoes, each holding
his own in his hand, and went down to the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of the sea and stood there, each pointing the nose
of his boat toward Waipio.</p>

<p>None of the people awoke until they landed.
They pulled the boats upon the beach and went
to their temple. As they came to the door of the
temple, drums beat like rolling thunder. Then
the sun arose, the mists all vanished from Hawaii.
The people awoke and understood that their
chiefs had returned. They ran out of their
houses shouting and rejoicing. Olopana commanded
the chiefs and the people to prepare all
kinds of sweet food and gifts and things for a very
great luau. When this was done they feasted
sixty days and returned to their homes.</p>

<p>Lei-makani became the ruler of Hawaii.
Lono-kai-o-lohia was honored by his father. All
of the chiefs in that generation were noted
throughout the islands.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was said that there was a beautiful chiefess
of Molokai who wanted to find a young chief of
Hawaii for her husband, so she sent her kahu, or
guardian, and servants to make the journey
while she went back to her sleeping-place and
dreamed of a very fine young chief shining like
the sun and surrounded by all the colors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
rainbow. Then she awoke and found no one,
but she loved that spirit-body which she had
seen in her dreams, so she arose and went down
to the beach and told her guardian to make haste
and reach Hawaii that day.</p>

<p>When the kahu heard her call, he put forth all
his power and uttered the proper incantations.
He sped through the waters like a skimming bird,
passed the great precipices near Waipio, and soon
after dawn landed on the beautiful beach.</p>

<p>The people had not yet come from their homes
for the work of the day. He went up to the
village and came near the house of Lei-makani.
A watchman asked where he was from and the
purpose of his journey. He said: "I am a
stranger from Molokai, a messenger from my
chiefess, who seeks a husband of high rank equal
to her own. She has no one worthy to be her
husband."</p>

<p>The Waipio chief said: "We have a splendid
young chief, but there is no one his equal in rank
and beauty. You could not ask for him."</p>

<p>Then Lei-makani heard the noise and came
out and asked about this conversation. His
watchman told him that this man was from
Molokai.</p>

<p>Lei-makani asked the man to approach. The
Molokai chief thought that Lei-makani was the
handsomest man he had ever seen. Ke-au-kai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
came out of the temple and looked upon the
stranger and asked why he had come.</p>

<p>When he learned that the man sought a husband
for his chiefess, he advised him to return
lest he should meet death at the hands of the
watchman, but the man would not go away.</p>

<p>After a time the chiefs of Waipio came before
Lei-makani. The Molokai chief explained his
errand, and praised his chiefess, and said that he
was willing to be killed and cooked in an oven if
she were not as beautiful and of as high rank
as he had told them. Lono-kai at that moment
entered the assembly, and the stranger cried out:
"This man is the husband for my chiefess. Her
tabu rank is the same as the tabu rank of this
fine young chief. No others in all the islands are
like these two. It would be glorious for them to
meet." Lono-kai said, "You return at once and
make preparation, and I will come in the evening."</p>

<p>The kahu returned to Molokai, but the chiefess
saw him coming back alone and became very
angry, her eyes flashing with wrath because he
had not brought the young chief with him. She
screamed out, "Where is the value of your journey,
if you return without my husband?"</p>

<p>"Wait a little," the guardian said gently,
"until you hear about what I have seen upon
Hawaii. I have found the one you wanted. We
must get ready to meet your husband, for the
young chief is coming here this evening. When
you meet, the love of each of you will be great
toward the other."</p>

<p>She ordered all Molokai to prepare for a great
feast commencing that evening. Messengers ran
swiftly, people and chiefs hastened their labors,
and by evening vast quantities of food had been
prepared.</p>

<p>Lono-kai took his cocoanut-husk boat and came
over the sea like a bird skimming the water.</p>

<p>As the sun sank and the evening shadows fell,
the two young people met and delighted in each
other's beauty. Then they were married in the
midst of all the people of Molokai.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE BRIDE FROM THE UNDER-WORLD</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Legend of the Kalakaua Family</span></p>


<p>Ku, one of the most widely known gods of the
Pacific Ocean, was thought by the Hawaiians
to have dwelt as a mortal for some time on
the western side of the island Hawaii. Here
he chose a chiefess by the name of Hina as his
wife, and to them were born two children. When
he withdrew from his residence among men he
left a son on the uplands of the district of North
Kona, and a daughter on the seashore of the same
district. The son, Hiku-i-kana-hele (Hiku of
the forest), lived with his mother. The daughter,
Kewalu, dwelt under the care of guardian
chiefs and priests by a temple, the ruined walls
of which are standing even to the present day.
Here she was carefully protected and perfected
in all arts pertaining to the very high chiefs.
Hiku-of-the-Forest was not accustomed to go
to the sea. His life was developed among the
forests along the western slopes of the great
mountains of Hawaii. Here he learned the wisdom
of his mother and of the chiefs and priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
under whose care he was placed. To him were
given many of the supernatural powers of his
father. His mother guarded him from the knowledge
that he had a sister and kept him from going
to the temple by the side of which she had her
home.</p>

<p>Hiku was proficient in all the feats of manly
strength and skill upon which chiefs of the highest
rank prided themselves. None of the chiefs of
the inland districts could compare with him in
symmetry of form, beauty of countenance, and
skill in manly sports.</p>

<p>The young chief noted the sounds of the forest
and the rushing winds along the sides of the
mountains. Sometimes, like storm voices, he
heard from far off the beat of the surf along the
coral reef. One day he heard a noise like the
flapping of the wings of many birds. He looked
toward the mountain, but no multitude of his
feathered friends could be found. Again the
same sound awakened his curiosity. He now
learned that it came from the distant seashore
far below his home on the mountain-side.</p>

<p>Hiku-of-the-Forest called his mother and together
they listened as again the strange sound
from the beach rose along the mountain gulches
and was echoed among the cliffs.</p>

<p>"E Hiku," said the mother, "that is the clapping
of the hands of a large number of men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
women. The people who live by the sea are
very much pleased and are expressing their
great delight in some wonderful deed of a great
chief."</p>

<p>Day after day the rejoicing of the people was
heard by the young chief. At last he sent a
trusty retainer to learn the cause of the tumult.
The messenger reported that he had found certain
tabu surf waters of the Kona beach and had
seen a very high chiefess who alone played with
her surf-board on the incoming waves. Her
beauty surpassed that of any other among all
the people, and her skill in riding the surf was
wonderful, exceeding that of any one whom the
people had ever seen, therefore the multitude
gathered from near and far to watch the marvelous
deeds of the beautiful woman. Their pleasure
was so great that when they clapped their
hands the sound was like the voices of many
thunder-storms.</p>

<p>The young chief said he must go down and see
this beautiful maiden. The mother knew that
this chiefess of such great beauty must be Kewalu,
the sister of Hiku. She feared that trouble
would come to Kewalu if her more powerful
brother should find her and take her in marriage,
as was the custom among the people. The
omens which had been watched concerning the
children in their infancy had predicted many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
serious troubles. But the young man could not
be restrained. He was determined to see the
wonderful woman.</p>

<p>He sent his people to gather the nuts of the
kukui, or candlenut-tree, and crush out the oil
and prepare it for anointing his body. He had
never used a surf-board, but he commanded his
servants to prepare the best one that could be
made. Down to the seashore Hiku went with
his retainers, down to the tabu place of the beautiful
Kewalu.</p>

<p>He anointed his body with the kukui oil until
it glistened like the polished leaves of trees;
then taking his surf-board he went boldly to the
tabu surf waters of his sister. The people stood
in amazed silence, expecting to see speedy punishment
meted out to the daring stranger. But
the gods of the sea favored Hiku. Hiku had
never been to the seaside and had never learned
the arts of those who were skilful in the waters.
Nevertheless as he entered the water he carried
the surf-board more royally than any chief the
people had ever known. The sunlight shone in
splendor upon his polished body when he stood
on the board and rode to the shore on the crests
of the highest surf waves, performing wonderful
feats by his magic power. The joy of the multitude
was unbounded, and a mighty storm of noise
was made by the clapping of their hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Kewalu and her maidens had left the beach
before the coming of Hiku and were resting in
their grass houses in a grove of cocoanut-trees
near the heiau. When the great noise made by
the people aroused her she sent one of her friends
to learn the cause of such rejoicing. When she
learned that an exceedingly handsome chief of the
highest rank was sporting among her tabu waters
she determined to see him.</p>

<p>So, calling her maidens, she went down to the
seashore and first saw Hiku on the highest crest
of the rolling surf. She decided at once that she
had never seen a man so comely, and Hiku, surf-riding
to the shore, felt that he had never dreamed
of such grace and beauty as marked the maiden
who was coming to welcome him.</p>

<p>When Kewalu came near she took the wreath
of rare and fragrant flowers which she wore
and coming close to him threw it around his
shoulders as a token to all the people that she
had taken him to be her husband.</p>

<p>Then the joy of the people surpassed all the
pleasure of all the days before, for they looked
upon the two most beautiful beings they had
ever seen and believed that these two would
make glad each other's lives.</p>

<p>Thus Hiku married his sister, Kewalu, according
to the custom of that time, because she was
the only one of all the people equal to him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
rank and beauty, and he alone was fitted to stand
in her presence.</p>

<p>For a long time they lived together, sometimes
sporting among the highest white crests of storm-tossed
surf waves, sometimes enjoying the guessing
and gambling games in which the Hawaiians
of all times have been very expert, sometimes
chanting meles and genealogies and telling marvelous
stories of sea and forest, and sometimes
feasting and resting under the trees surrounding
their grass houses.</p>

<p>Hiku at last grew weary of the life by the sea.
He wanted the forest on the mountain and the
cold, stimulating air of the uplands. But he did
not wish to take his sister-wife with him. Perhaps
the omens of their childhood had revealed
danger to Kewalu if she left her home by the sea.
Whenever he tried to steal away from her she
would rush to him and cling to him, persuading
him to wait for new sports and joys.</p>

<p>One night Hiku rose up very quietly and passed
out into the darkness. As he began to climb
toward the uplands the leaves of the trees rustled
loudly in welcome. The night birds circled
around him and hastened him on his way, but
Kewalu was awakened. She called for Hiku.
Again and again she called, but Hiku had gone.
She heard his footsteps as his eager tread shook
the ground. She heard the branches breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
as he forced his way through the forests. Then
she hastened after him and her plaintive cry was
louder and clearer than the voices of the night
birds.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"E Hiku, return! E Hiku, return!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O my love, wait for Kewalu!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Hiku goes up the hills;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Very hard is this hill, O Hiku!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Hiku, my beloved!"<br />
</p>

<p>But Hiku by his magic power sent thick fogs
and mists around her. She was blinded and
chilled, but she heard the crashing of the branches
and ferns as Hiku forced his way through them,
and she pressed on, still calling:</p>

<p>"E Hiku, beloved, return to Kewalu."</p>

<p>Then the young chief threw the long flexible
vines of the ieie down into the path. They
twined around her feet and made her stumble as
she tried to follow him. The rain was falling all
around her, and the way was very rough and
hard. She slipped and fell again and again.</p>

<p>The ancient chant connected with the legend
says:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Hiku is climbing up the hill.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Branches and vines are in the way,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And Kewalu is begging him to stop.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Rain-drops are walking on the leaves.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers are beaten to the ground.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Hopeless the quest, but Kewalu is calling:<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;'E Hiku, beloved! Let us go back together.'"<br />

<p>Her tears, mingled with the rain, streamed
down her cheeks. The storm wet and destroyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>the kapa mantle which she had thrown around
her as she hurried from her home after Hiku. In
rags she tried to force her way through the
tangled undergrowth of the uplands, but as
she crept forward step by step she stumbled and
fell again into the cold wet arms of the ferns and
grasses. Then the vines crept up around her
legs and her arms and held her, but she tore
them loose and forced her way upward, still
calling. She was bleeding where the rough hands
of the forest had torn her delicate flesh. She
was so bruised and sore from the blows which
the branches had showered upon her that she
could scarcely creep under them.</p>

<p>At last she could no longer hear the retreating
footsteps of Hiku. Then, chilled and desolate
and deserted, she gave up in despair and crept
back to the village. There she crawled into the
grass house where she had been so happy with
her brother Hiku, intending to put an end to her
life.</p>

<p>The ieie vines held her arms and legs, but she
partially disentangled herself and wound them
around her head and neck. Soon the tendrils
grew tight and slowly but surely choked the
beautiful chiefess to death. This was the first
suicide in the records of Hawaiian mythology.
As the body gradually became lifeless the spirit
crept upward to the lua-uhane, the door by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
it passed out of the body into the spirit world.
This "spirit-door" is the little hole in the corner
of the eye. Out of it the spirit is thought to
creep slowly as the body becomes cold in death.
The spirit left the cold body a prisoner to the
tangled vines, and slowly and sadly journeyed
to Milu, the Under-world home of the ghosts of
the departed.</p>

<p>The lust of the forest had taken possession of
Hiku. He felt the freedom of the swift birds
who had been his companions in many an excursion
into the heavily shaded depths of the forest
jungles. He plunged with abandon into the
whirl and rush of the storm winds which he had
called to his aid to check Kewalu. He was
drunken with the atmosphere which he had
breathed throughout his childhood and young
manhood. When he thought of Kewalu he was
sure that he had driven her back to her home by
the temple, where he could find her when once
more he should seek the seashore.</p>

<p>He had only purposed to stay a while on the
uplands, and then return to his sister-wife.</p>

<p>His father, the god Ku, had been watching him
and had also seen the suicide of the beautiful
Kewalu. He saw the spirit pass down to the
kingdom of Milu, the home of the ghosts. Then
he called Hiku and told him how heedless and
thoughtless he had been in his treatment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Kewalu, and how in despair she had taken her
life, the spirit going to the Under-world.</p>

<p>Hiku, the child of the forest, was overcome with
grief. He was ready to do anything to atone
for the suffering he had caused Kewalu, and repair
the injury.</p>

<p>Ku told him that only by the most daring
effort could he hope to regain his loved bride.
He could go to the Under-world, meet the ghosts
and bring his sister back, but this could only be
done at very great risk to himself, for if the ghosts
discovered and captured him they would punish
him with severest torments and destroy all hope
of returning to the Upper-world.</p>

<p>Hiku was determined to search the land of
Milu and find his bride and bring her back to
his Kona home by the sea. Ku agreed to aid
him with the mighty power which he had as a
god, nevertheless it was absolutely necessary
that Hiku should descend alone and by his own
wit and skill secure the ghost of Kewalu.</p>

<p>Hiku prepared a cocoanut-shell full of oil made
from decayed kukui nuts. This was very vile
and foul smelling. Then he made a long stout
rope of ieie vines.</p>

<p>Ku knew where the door to the Under-world
was, through which human beings could go down.
This was a hole near the seashore in the valley of
Waipio on the eastern coast of the island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Ku and Hiku went to Waipio, descended the
precipitous walls of the valley and found the
door to the pit of Milu. Milu was the ruler of
the Under-world.</p>

<p>Hiku rubbed his body all over with the rancid
kukui oil and then gave the ieie vine into the
keeping of his father to hold fast while he made
his descent into the world of the spirits of the
dead. Slowly Ku let the vine down until at
last Hiku stood in the strange land of Milu.</p>

<p>No one noticed his coming and so for a little
while he watched the ghosts, studying his best
method of finding Kewalu. Some of the ghosts
were sleeping; some were gambling and playing
the same games they had loved so well while
living in the Upper-world; others were feasting
and visiting around the poi bowl as they had
formerly been accustomed to do.</p>

<p>Hiku knew that the strong odor of the rotten
oil would be his best protection, for none of the
spirits would want to touch him and so would not
discover that he was flesh and blood. Therefore
he rubbed his body once more thoroughly with
the oil and disfigured himself with dirt. As he
passed from place to place searching for Kewalu,
the ghosts said, "What a bad-smelling spirit!"
So they turned away from him as if he was one
of the most unworthy ghosts dwelling in Milu.
In the realm of Milu he saw the people in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
game of rolling cocoanut-shells to hit a post.
Kulioe, one of the spirits, had been playing the
kilu and had lost all his property to the daughter
of Milu and one of her friends. He saw Hiku
and said, "If you are a skilful man perhaps you
should play with these two girls." Hiku said:
"I have nothing. I have only come this day
and am alone." Kulioe bet his bones against
some of the property he had lost. The first
girl threw her cup at the kilu post. Hiku
chanted:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Are you known by Papa and Wakea,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O eyelashes or rays of the sun?<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Mine is the cup of kilu."<br />
</p>

<p>Her cup did not touch the kilu post before Hiku.
She threw again, but did not touch, while Hiku
chanted the same words. They took a new cup,
but failed.</p>

<p>Hiku commenced swinging the cup and threw.
It glided and twisted around on the floor and
struck the post. This counted five and won the
first bet. Then he threw the cup numbered
twenty, won all the property and gave it back
to Kulioe.</p>

<p>At last he found Kewalu, but she was by the
side of the high chief, Milu, who had seen the
beautiful princess as she came into the Under-world.
More glorious was Kewalu than any
other of all those of noble blood who had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
descended to Milu. The ghosts had welcomed
the spirit of the princess with great rejoicing, and
the king had called her at once to the highest
place in his court.</p>

<p>She had not been long with the chiefs of Milu
before they asked her to sing or chant her mele.
The mele was the family song by which any
chief made known his rank and the family with
which he was connected, whenever he visited
chiefs far away from his own home.</p>

<p>Hiku heard the chant and mingled with the
multitude of ghosts gathered around the place
where the high chiefs were welcoming the spirit
of Kewalu.</p>

<p>While Hiku and Kewalu had been living together
one of their pleasures was composing
and learning to intone a chant which no other
among either mortals or spirits should know
besides themselves.</p>

<p>While Kewalu was singing she introduced her
part of this chant. Suddenly from among the
throng of ghosts arose the sound of a clear voice
chanting the response which was known by no
other person but Hiku.</p>

<p>Kewalu was overcome by the thought that
perhaps Hiku was dead and was now among the
ghosts, but did not dare to incur the hatred of
King Milu by making himself known; or perhaps
Hiku had endured many dangers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
lower world by coming even in human form to
find her and therefore must remain concealed.</p>

<p>The people around the king, seeing her grief,
were not surprised when she threw a mantle
around herself and left them to go away alone
into the shadows.</p>

<p>She wandered from place to place among the
groups of ghosts, looking for Hiku. Sometimes
she softly chanted her part of the mele. At last
she was again answered and was sure that Hiku
was near, but the only one very close was a foul-smelling,
dirt-covered ghost from whom she was
turning away in despair.</p>

<p>Hiku in a low tone warned her to be very
careful and not recognize him, but assured her
that he had come in person to rescue her and
take her back to her old home where her body
was then lying. He told her to wander around
and yet to follow him until they came to the
ieie vine which he had left hanging from the hole
which opened to the Upper-world.</p>

<p>When Hiku came to the place where the vine
was hanging he took hold to see if Ku, his father,
was still carefully guarding the other end to pull
him up when the right signal should be given.
Having made himself sure of the aid of the god,
he tied the end of the vine into a strong loop and
seated himself in it. Then he began to swing
back and forth, back and forth, sometimes rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
high and sometimes checking himself and resting
with his feet on the ground.</p>

<p>Kewalu came near and begged to be allowed
to swing, but Hiku would only consent on the
condition that she would sit in his lap.</p>

<p>The ghosts thought that this would be an excellent
arrangement and shouted their approval
of the new sport. Then Hiku took the spirit of
Kewalu in his strong arms and began to swing
slowly back and forth, then more and more
rapidly, higher and higher until the people marvelled
at the wonderful skill. Meanwhile he
gave the signal to Ku to pull them up. Almost
imperceptibly the swing receded from the spirit
world.</p>

<p>All this time Hiku had been gently and lovingly
rubbing the spirit of Kewalu and softly
uttering charm after charm so that while they
were swaying in the air she was growing smaller
and smaller. Even the chiefs of Milu had been
attracted to this unusual sport, and had drawn
near to watch the wonderful skill of the strange
foul-smelling ghost.</p>

<p>Suddenly it dawned upon some of the beholders
that the vine was being drawn up to the Upper-world.
Then the cry arose: "He is stealing the
woman!" "He is stealing the woman!"</p>

<p>The Under-world was in a great uproar of
noise. Some of the ghosts were leaping as high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
as they could, others were calling for Hiku to
return, and others were uttering charms to
cause his downfall.</p>

<p>No one could leap high enough to touch Hiku,
and the power of all the charms was defeated by
the god Ku, who rapidly drew the vine upward.</p>

<p>Hiku succeeded in charming the ghost of Kewalu
into the cocoanut-shell which he still carried.
Then stopping the opening tight with his fingers
so that the spirit could not escape he brought
Kewalu back to the land of mortals.</p>

<p>With the aid of Ku the steep precipices surrounding
Waipio Valley were quickly scaled and
the journey made to the temple by the tabu
surf waters of Kona. Here the body of Kewalu
had been lying in state. Here the auwe, or
mourning chant, of the retinue of the dead
princess could be heard from afar.</p>

<p>Hiku passed through the throngs of mourners,
carefully guarding his precious cocoanut until
he came to the feet, cold and stiff in death.
Kneeling down he placed the small hole in the
end of the shell against the tender spot in the
bottom of one of the cold feet.</p>

<p>The spirits of the dead must find their way
back little by little through the body from the
feet to the eyes, from which they must depart
when they bid final farewell to the world. To
try to send the spirit back into the body by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
placing it in the lua-uhane, or "door of the soul,"
would be to have it where it had to depart from
the body rather than enter it.</p>

<p>Hiku removed his finger from the hole in the
cocoanut and uttered the incantations which
would allure the ghost into the body. Little by
little the soul of Kewalu came back, and the
body grew warm from the feet upward, until at
last the eyes opened and the soul looked out
upon the blessed life restored to it by the skill
and bravery of Hiku.</p>

<p>No more troubles arose to darken the lives of
the children of Ku. Whether in the forest or
by the sea they made the days pleasant for each
other until at the appointed time together they
entered the shades of Milu as chief and chiefess
who could not be separated. It is said that the
generations of their children gave many rulers
to the Hawaiians, and that the present royal
family, the "House of Kalakaua," is the last of
the descendants.</p>

<p class="center">THE DECEIVING OF KEWA</p>

<p>A poem, or mourning chant, of the Maoris of New Zealand
has many references to the deeds of their ancestors in Hawaiki,
which in this case surely has reference to the Hawaiian
Islands. Among the first lines of this poem is the expression,
"Kewa was deceived." An explanatory note is given
which covers almost two pages of the Journal of the Polynesian
Society in which the poem is published. In this
note the outline of the story of the deceiving of Kewa is
quite fully translated, and is substantially the same as "The
Bride from the Under-world."</p>

<p>"The Deceiving of Kewa," as the New Zealand story is
called, has this record among the Maoris. "This narrative
is of old, of ancient times, very, very old. 'The Deceiving
of Kewa' is an old, old story." Milu in some parts of the
Pacific is the name of the place where the spirits of the dead
dwell. Sometimes it is the name of the ruler of that place.
In this ancient New Zealand legend it takes the place of
Hiku, and is the name of the person who goes down into the
depths after his bride, while the spirit-king is called Kewa,
a part of the name Kewalu, which was the name of the
Hawaiian bride whose ghost was brought back from the
grave.</p>

<p>This, then, is the New Zealand legend, "The Deceiving of
Kewa." There once lived in Hawaiki a chief and his wife.
They had a child, a girl, born to them; then the mother
died. The chief took another wife, who was not pleasing
to the people. His anger was so great that the chief went
away to the great forest of Tane (the god Kane in Hawaiian),
and there built a house for himself and his wife.</p>

<p>After a time a son was born to them and the father named
him Miru. This father was a great tohunga (kahuna), or
priest, as well as a chief. He taught Miru all the supreme
kinds of knowledge, all the invocations and incantations, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
for the stars, for the winds, for foods, for the sea, and for the
land. He taught him the peculiar incantations which would
enable him to meet all cunning tricks and enmities of man.
He learned also all the great powers of witchcraft. It is
said that on one occasion Miru and his father went to a river,
a great river. Here the child experimented with his powerful
charms. He was a child of the forest and knew the
charm which could conquer the trees. Now there was a
tall tree growing by the side of the river. When Miru saw
it he recited his incantations. As he came to the end the
tree fell, the head reaching right across the river. They
left the tree lying in this way that it might be used as a
bridge by the people who came to the river. Thus he was
conscious of his power to correctly use the mighty invocations
which his father had taught him.</p>

<p>The years passed and the boy became a young man. His
was a lonely life, and he often wondered if there were not
those who could be his companions. At last he asked his
parents: "Are we here, all of us? Have I no other relative
in the world?"</p>

<p>His parents answered, "You have a sister, but she dwells
at a distant place."</p>

<p>When Miru heard this he arose and proceeded to search
for his sister, and he happily came to the very place where
she dwelt. There the young people were gathered in their
customary place for playing teka (Hawaiian keha). The
teka was a dart which was thrown along the ground, usually
the hard beach of the seashore. Miru watched the game for
some time and then returned to his home in the forest. He
told his father about the teka and the way it was played.
Then the chief prepared a teka for Miru, selected from the
best tree and fashioned while appropriate charms were
repeated.</p>

<p>Miru threw his dart along the slopes covered by the forest
and its underbrush, but the ground was uneven and the
undergrowth retarded the dart. Then Miru found a plain
and practised until he was very expert.</p>

<p>After a while he came to the place where his sister lived.
When the young people threw their darts he threw his. Aha!
it flew indeed and was lost in the distance. When the sister
beheld him she at once felt a great desire toward him.</p>

<p>The people tried to keep Miru with them, pleading with
him to stay, and even following him as he returned to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
forest home, but they caught him not. Frequently he repeated
his visits, but never stayed long.</p>

<p>The sister, whose name is not given in the New Zealand legends,
was disheartened, and hanged herself until she was
dead. The body was laid in its place for the time of wailing.
Miru and his father came to the uhunga, or place of mourning.
The people had not known that Miru was the brother of the
one who was dead. They welcomed the father and son
according to their custom. Then the young man said,
"After I leave, do not bury my sister." So the body was left
in its place when the young man arose.</p>

<p>He went on his way till he saw a canoe floating. He then
gave the command to his companions and they all paddled
away in the canoe. They paddled on for a long distance, in
fact to Rerenga-wai-rua, the point of land in New Zealand
from which the spirits of the dead take their last leap as they
go down to the Under-world. When they reached this place
they rested, and Miru let go the anchor. He then said to
his companions, "When you see the anchor rope shaking,
pull it up, but wait here for me."</p>

<p>The young man then leaped into the water and went down,
down near the bottom, and then entered a cave. This cave
was the road by which the departed spirits went to spirit-land.
Miru soon saw a house standing there. It was the
home of Kewa, the chief of the Under-world. Within the
house was his sister in spirit form.</p>

<p>Miru carried with him his nets which were given magic
power, with which he hoped to catch the spirit of his sister.
In many ways he endeavored to induce her ghost to come
forth from the house of Kewa, but she would not come. He
commenced whipping his top in the yard outside, but could
not attract her attention. At last he set up a swing and
many of the ghosts joined in the pastime. For a long time the
sister remained within, but eventually came forth induced
by the attraction of the swing and by the appearance of Miru.
Miru then took the spirit in his arms and began to swing.</p>

<p>Higher and higher they rose whilst he incited the ghosts
to increase to the utmost the flight of the moari, or swing. On
reaching the highest point he gathered the spirit of the sister
into his net, then letting go the swing away they flew and
alighted quite outside the spirit-land.</p>

<p>Thence he went to the place where the anchor of the floating
canoe was. Shaking the rope his friends understood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
signal. He was drawn up with the ghost in his net. He
entered the canoe and returned home. On arrival at the
settlement the people were still lamenting. What was that
to him? Taking the spirit he laid it on the dead body, at the
same time reciting his incantations. The spirit gradually
entered the body and the sister was alive again. This is the
end of the narrative, but it is of old, of ancient times, very,
very old. "The Deceiving of Kewa" is an old, old story.</p>

<p>In the Maori poem in which the reference to Kewa is made
which brought out the above translation of one of the old
New Zealand stories are also many other references to semi-historical
characters and events. At the close of the poem
is the following note: "The lament is so full of references to
the ancient history of the Maoris that it would take a volume
to explain them all. Most of the incidents referred to occurred
in Hawaiki before the migration of the Maoris to New
Zealand or at least five hundred to six hundred years ago."</p>

<p>Another New Zealand legend ought to be noticed in connection
with the Hawaiian story of Hiku (Miru, New Zealand)
seeking his sister in the Under-world. In what is probably
the more complete Hawaiian story Hiku had a magic arrow
which flew long distances and led him to the place where his
sister-wife could be found.</p>

<p>In a New Zealand legend a magic dart leads a chief by the
name of Tama in his search for his wife, who had been carried
away to spirit-land. He threw the dart and followed it from
place to place until he found a wrecked canoe, near which
lay the body of his wife and her companions. He tried to
bring her back to life, but his incantations were not strong
enough to release the spirit.</p>

<p>Evidently the Hawaiian legend became a little fragmentary
while being transplanted from the Hawaiian Islands to
New Zealand. Hiku, the young chief who overcomes Miru
of the spirit-world, loses his name entirely. Kewalu, the
sister, also loses her name, a part of which, Kewa, is given
to the ruler of the Under-world, and the magic dart is placed
in the hands of Tama in an entirely distinct legend which
still keeps the thought of the wife-seeker. There can scarcely
be any question but that the original legend belongs to the
Hawaiian Islands, and was carried to New Zealand in the
days of the sea-rovers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HOMELESS AND DESOLATE GHOSTS</p>

<p>The spirits of the dead, according to a summary of ancient
Hawaiian statements, were divided into three classes, each
class bearing the prefix "ao," which meant either the enlightened
or instructed class, or simply a crowd or number of
spirits grouped together.</p>

<p>The first class, the Ao-Kuewa, were the desolate and the
homeless spirits who during their residence in the body had
no friends and no property.</p>

<p>The second class was called the Ao-Aumakuas. These were
the groups of ghost-gods or spirit-ancestors of the Hawaiians.
They usually remained near their old home as helpful protectors
of the family to which they belonged, and were worshipped
by the family.</p>

<p>The third class was the Ao-o-Milu. Milu was the chief god
of the Under-world throughout the greater part of Polynesia.
Many times the Under-world itself bore the name of Milu.
The Ao-o-Milu were the souls of the departed of both the
preceding classes who had performed all tasks, passed all
barriers, and found their proper place in the land of the king
of ghosts.</p>

<p>The Old Hawaiians never intelligently classified these
departed spirits and sometimes mixed them together in inextricable
confusion, but in the legends and remarks of early
Hawaiian writers these three classes are roughly sketched.
The desolate ghost had no right to call any place its home,
to which it could come, over which it could watch, and around
which it could hover. It had to go to the desolate parts of
the islands or into a wilderness or forest.</p>

<p>The homeless ghost had no one to provide even the shadow
of food for it. It had to go into the dark places and search
for butterflies, spiders, and other insects. These were the
ordinary food for all ghosts unless there were worshippers
to place offerings on secret altars, which were often dedicated
to gain a special power of praying other people to death. Such
ghosts were well cared for, but, on the other hand, the desolate
ones must wander and search until they could go down into
the land of Milu.</p>

<p>There were several ways which the gods had prepared for
ghosts to use in this journey to the Under-world. It is inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>esting
to note that all through Polynesia as well as in the
Hawaiian Islands the path for ghosts led westward.</p>

<p>The students of New Zealand folk-lore will say that this
signified the desire of those about to die to return to the land
of their ancestors beyond the western ocean.</p>

<p>The paths were called Leina-a-ka-uhane (paths-for-leaping-by-the-spirit).
They were almost always on bold bluffs
looking westward over the ocean. The spirit unless driven
back could come to the headland and leap down into the land
of the dead, but when this was done that spirit could never
return to the body it had left. Frequently connected with
these Leina-a-ka-uhane was a breadfruit-tree which would
be a gathering-place for ghosts.</p>

<p>At these places there were often friendly ghosts who
would help and sometimes return the spirit to the body or
send it to join the Ao-Aumakuas (ancestor ghosts). At the
place of descent it was said there was an owawa (ditch)
through which the ghosts one by one were carried down to
Po, and Lei-lono was the gate where the ghosts were killed
as they went down. Near this gateway was the Ulu-o-lei-walo,
or breadfruit-tree of the spirits. This tree had two
branches, one toward the east and one toward the west,
both of which were used by the ghosts. One was for leaping
into eternal darkness into Po-pau-ole, the other as a meeting-place
with the helpful gods.</p>

<p>This tree always bore the name Ulu-o-lei-walo (the-quietly-calling-breadfruit-tree).
On the island of Oahu,
one of these was said to have been at Kaena Point; another
was in Nuuanu Valley.</p>

<p>The desolate ghost would come to this meeting-place of
the dead and try to find a ghost of the second class, the
aumakuas, who had been one of his ancestors and who still
had some family to watch over. Perhaps this one might
entertain or help him.</p>

<p>If the ghost could find no one to take him, then he would
try to wander around the tree and leap into the branches.
The rotten, dead branches of the tree belonged to the spirits.
When they broke and fell, the spirits on them dropped into
the land of Milu&mdash;the under-world home of ghosts. Often
the spirit could leap from these dead branches into the Under-world.</p>

<p>Sometimes the desolate spirit would be blown, as by the
wind, back and forth, here and there, until no possible place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of rest could be found on the island where death had come;
then the ghost would leap into the sea, hoping to find the way
to Milu through some sea-cave. Perhaps the waves would
carry the ghost, or it might be able to swim to one of the
other islands, where a new search would be made for some
ancestor-ghost from which to obtain help. Not finding
aid, it would be pushed and driven over rough, rocky places
and through the wilderness until it again went into the sea.
At last perhaps a way would be found into the home of the
dead, and the ghost would have a place in which to live,
or it might make the round through the wilderness again and
again, until it could leap from a bluff, or fall from a rotten
branch of the breadfruit-tree.</p>

<p>A great caterpillar was the watchman on the eastern side
of the leaping-off place. Napaha was the western boundary.
A mo-o (dragon) was the watchman on that side. If the
ghost was afraid of them it went back to secure the help
of the ghost-gods in order to get by. The Hawaiians were
afraid that these watchmen would kill ghosts if possible.</p>

<p>If a caterpillar obstructed the way it would raise its head
over the edge of the bluff, and then the frightened ghost
would go far out of its way, and wandering around be destroyed
or compelled to leap off some dead branch into eternal darkness.
But if that frightened ghost, while wandering, could
find a helpful ghost god, it would be kept alive, although
still a wanderer over the islands.</p>

<p>At the field of kaupea (coral) near Barbers Point, in the
desert of Puuloa, the ghost would go around among the lehua
flowers, catching spiders, butterflies, and insects for food,
where the ghost-gods might find them and give them aid in
escaping the watchmen.</p>

<p>There are many places for the Leina-a-ka-uhane (leaping-off-places)
and the Ulu-o-lei-walo (breadfruit-trees) on all the
islands. To these places the wandering desolate ghosts went
to find a way to the Under-world.</p>

<p>Another name for the wandering ghosts was lapu, also
sometimes called Akua-hele-loa (great travellers). These
ghosts were frequently those who enjoyed foolish, silly
pranks. They would sweep over the old byways in troops,
dancing and playing. They would gather around the old
mats where the living had been feasting, and sit and feast on
imaginary food.</p>

<p>The Hawaiians say: "On one side of the island Oahu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
even to this day the lapu come at night. Their ghost drums
and sacred chants can be heard and their misty forms seen
as they hover about the ruins of the old heiaus (temples)."</p>

<p>The fine mists or fogs of Manoa Valley were supposed to
conceal a large company of priests and their attendants while
roaming among the great stones which still lie where there
was a puu-honua (refuge-temple) in the early days. If any
one saw these roving ghosts he was called lapu-ia, or one to
whom spirits had appeared.</p>

<p>The Hawaiians said: "The lapu ghosts were not supposed
to watch over the welfare of the persons they met. They
never went into the heavens to become black clouds, bringing
rain for the benefit of their households. They did not go
out after winds to blow with destructive force against their
enemies. This was the earnest work of the ancestor-ghosts,
and was not done by the lapu."</p>

<p>Another name for ghosts was wai-lua, which referred
especially to the spirit leaving the body and supposed to
have been seen by some one. This wai-lua spirit could be
driven back into the body by other ghosts, or persuaded to
come back through offerings or incantations given by living
friends, so that a dead person could become alive again.</p>

<p>It was firmly believed that a person could endure many
deaths, and that if any one lost consciousness he was dead,
and that when life stopped it was because the spirit left
the body. When life was renewed it was because the spirit
had returned to its former home.</p>

<p>The kino-wai-lua was a ghost leaving the body of a living
person and returning after a time, as when any one fainted.</p>

<p>Besides the ghosts of the dead, the Hawaiians gave spirit
power to all natural objects. Large stones were supposed
to have dragon power sometimes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="center">AUMAKUAS, OR ANCESTOR-GHOSTS</p>

<p>There are two meanings to the first part of this word, for
"au" means a multitude, as in "auwaa" (many canoes), but
it may mean time and place, as in the following: "Our
ancestors thought that if there was a desolate place where
no man could be found, it was the aumakua (place of many
gods)." "Makua" was the name given to the ancestors of
a chief and of the people as well as to parents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The aumakuas were the ghosts who did not go down into
Po, the land of King Milu. They were in the land of the
living, hovering around the families from which they had
been separated by death. They were the guardians of these
families.</p>

<p>When any one died, many devices were employed in disposing
of the body. The fact that an enemy of the family
might endeavor to secure the bones of the dead for the purpose
of making them into fish-hooks, arrow-heads, or spear-heads
led the surviving members of a family either to destroy
or to conceal the body of the dead. For if the bones were
so used it meant great dishonor, and the spirit was supposed
to suffer on account of this indignity.</p>

<p>Sometimes the flesh was stripped from the bones and cast
into the ocean or into the fires of the volcanoes, that the ghost
might be made a part of the family ghosts who lived in such
places, and the bones were buried in some secret cave or pit,
or folded together in a bundle which was thought to resemble
a grasshopper, so these were called unihipili (grasshopper).
The unihipili bones were used in connection with a strange
belief called pule-ana-ana (praying to death).</p>

<p>When the body of a dead person was to be hidden, only
two or three men were employed in the task. Sometimes
the one highest in rank would slay his helpers so that no
one except himself would know the burial-place.</p>

<p>The tools, the clothing, and the calabashes of the dead
were unclean until certain ceremonies of purification had
been faithfully performed. Many times these possessions
were either placed in the burial-cave beside the body or burned
so that they might be the property of the spirit in ghost-land.</p>

<p>The people who cared for the body had to bathe in salt
water and separate themselves from the family for a time.
They must sprinkle the house and all things inside with salt
water. After a few days the family would return and occupy
the house once more.</p>

<p>Usually the caretakers of a dead body would make a hole
in the side of the house and push it through rather than take
it through the old doorway, probably having the idea that
the ghost would only know the door through which the
body had gone out when alive and so could not find the new
way back when the opening was dosed.</p>

<p>After death came, the ghost crept out of the body, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
up from the feet until it rested in the eyes, and then it came
out from the corner of one eye, and had a kind of wind body.
It could pass around the room and out of doors through
any opening it could find. It could perch like a bird on the
roof of a house or in the branches of trees, or it could seat
itself on logs or stones near the house. It might have to
go back into the body and make it live again. Possibly
the ghost might meet some old ancestor-ghosts and be led
so far away that it could not return; then it must become a
member of the aumakua, or ancestor-ghost, family, or wander
off to join the homeless desolate ghost vagabonds.</p>

<p>Sometimes dead bodies were thrown into the sea with the
hope that the ghost body would become a shark or an eel,
or perhaps a mo-o, or dragon-god, to be worshipped with other
ancestor-gods of the same class.</p>

<p>Sometimes the body or the bones would be cast into the
crater of Kilauea, the people thinking the spirit would become
a flame of fire like Pele, the goddess of volcanoes; other
spirits went into the air concealed in the dark depths of the
sky, perhaps in the clouds.</p>

<p>Here they carried on the work needed to help their families.
They would become fog or mist or the fine misty rain
colored by light. With these the Rainbow Maiden, Anuenue,
delighted to dwell. They often lived in the great rolling white
clouds, or in the gray clouds which let fall the quiet rain
needed for farming. They also lived in the fierce black
thunder-clouds which sent down floods of a devastating
character upon the enemies of the family to which they
belonged.</p>

<p>There were ghost ancestors who made their homes near the
places where the members of their families toiled; there were
ancestor-ghosts to take care of the tapa, or kapa, makers, or
the calabash or house or canoe makers. There were special
ancestor-ghosts called upon by name by the farmers, the
fishermen, and the bird-hunters. These ghosts had their
own kuleanas, or places to which they belonged, and in which
they had their own peculiar duties and privileges. They
became ancestor ghost-gods and dwelt on the islands near
the homes of their worshippers, or in the air above, or in the
trees around the houses, or in the ocean or in the glowing
fires of volcanoes. They even dwelt in human beings, making
them shake or sneeze as with cold, and then a person was
said to become an ipu, or calabash containing a ghost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes it was thought that a ghost god could be seen
sitting on the head or shoulder of the person to whom it
belonged. Even in this twentieth century a native woman
told the writer that she saw a ghost-god whispering in his ear
while he was making an address. She said, "That ghost
was like a fire or a colored light." Many times the Hawaiians
have testified that they believed in the presence of their
ancestor ghost-gods.</p>

<p>This is the way the presence of a ghost was detected:
Some sound would be heard, such as a sibilant noise, a soft
whistle, or something like murmurs, or some sensation in a
part of the body might be felt. If an eyelid trembled, a
ghost was sitting on that spot. A quivering or creepy feeling
in any part of the body meant that a ghost was touching that
place. If any of these things happened, a person would cry
out, "I have seen or felt a spirit of the gods."</p>

<p>Sometimes people thought they saw the spirits of their
ghost friends. They believed that the spirits of these friends
appeared in the night, sometimes to kill any one who was
in the way. The high chiefs and warriors are supposed to
march and go in crowds, carrying their spears and piercing
those they met unless some ghost recognized that one and
called to the others, "Alia [wait]," but if the word was "O-i-o
[throw the spear]!" then that spirit's spear would strike
death to the passer-by.</p>

<p>There were night noises which the natives attributed to
sounds or rustling motions made by such night gods as the
following:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Akua-hokio (whistling gods).<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-kiei (peeping gods).<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-nalo (prying gods).<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-loa (long gods).<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-poko (short gods).<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-muki (sibilant gods).<br />
</p>

<p>A prayer to these read thus:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O Akua-loa! [long god]<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Akua-poko! [short god]<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Akua-muki! [god breathing in short, sibilant breaths]<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Akua-hokio! [god blowing like whistling winds]<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Akua-kiei! [god watching, peeping at one]<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O Akua-nalo! [god hiding, slipping out of sight]<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O All ye Gods, who travel on the dark night paths!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Come and eat.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Give life to me,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And my parents,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And my children,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;To us who are living in this place. Amama [Amen]."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>This prayer was offered every night as a protection against
the ghosts.</p>

<p>The aumakuas were very laka (tame and helpful). It was
said that an aumakua living in a shark would be very laka,
and would come to be rubbed on the head, opening his mouth
for a sacrifice. Perhaps some awa, or meat, would be placed
in his mouth, and then he would go away. So also if the aumakua
were a bird, it would become tame. If it were the
alae (a small duck), it would come to the hand of its worshipper;
if the pueo (owl), it would come and scratch the
earth away from the grave of one of its worshippers, throwing
the sand away with its wings, and would bring the body
back to life. An owl ancestor-god would come and set a
worshipper free were he a prisoner with hands and feet bound
by ropes.</p>

<p>It made no difference whether the dead person were male
or female, child or aged one, the spirit could become a ghost-god
and watch over the family.</p>

<p>There were altars for the ancestor-gods in almost every land.
These were frequently only little piles of white coral, but
sometimes chiefs would build a small house for their ancestor-gods,
thus making homes that the ghosts might have a kuleana,
or place of their own, where offerings could be placed, and
prayers offered, and rest enjoyed.</p>

<p>The Hawaiians have this to say about sacrifices for the
aumakuas: If a mo-o, or dragon-god, was angry with its
caretaker or his family and they became weak and sick,
they would sacrifice a spotted dog with awa, red fish, red
sugar-cane, and some of the grass growing in taro patches
wrapped in yellow kapa. This they would take to the lua,
or hole, where the mo-o dwelt, and fasten the bundle there.
Then the mo-o would become pleasant and take away the
sickness. If it were a shark-god, the sacrifice was a black pig,
a dark red chicken, and some awa wrapped in new white kapa
made by a virgin. This bundle would be carried to the
beach, where a prayer would be offered:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O aumakuas from sunrise to sunset,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From North to South, from above and below,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O spirits of the precipice and spirits of the sea,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;All who dwell in flowing waters,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a sacrifice&mdash;our gifts are to you.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Bring life to us, to all the family,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;To the old people with wrinkled skin,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;To the young also.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;This is our life,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From the gods."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the farmer would throw the bundle into the sea, bury
the chicken alive, take the pig to the temple, then go back to
his house looking for rain. If there was rain, it showed that
the aumakua had seen the gifts and washed away the wrong.
If the clouds became black with heavy rain, that was well.</p>

<p>The offerings for Pele and Hiiaka were awa to drink and
food to eat, in fact all things which could be taken to the
crater.</p>

<p>This applies to the four great gods, Kane, Ku, Lono, and
Kanaloa. They are called the first of the ancestors. Each
one of these was supposed to be able to appear in a number
of different forms, therefore each had a number of names
expressive of the work he intended or was desired to do. An
explanatory adjective or phrase was added to the god's own
name, defining certain acts or characteristics, thus: Kane-puaa
(Kane, the pig) was Kane who would aid in stirring up
the ground like a pig.</p>

<p>This is one of the prayers used when presenting offerings
to aumakuas, "O Aumakuas of the rising of the sun, guarded
by every tabu staff, here are offerings and sacrifices&mdash;the
black pig, the white chicken, the black cocoanut, the red
fish&mdash;sacrifices for the gods and all the aumakuas; those of
the ancestors, those of the night, and of the dawn, here am I.
Let life come."</p>

<p>The ancestor-gods were supposed to use whatever object
they lived with. If ghosts went up into the clouds, they
moved the clouds from place to place and made them assume
such shape as might be fancied. Thus they would reveal
themselves over their old homes.</p>

<p>All the aumakuas were supposed to be gentle and ready to
help their own families. The old Hawaiians say that the
power of the ancestor-gods was very great. "Here is the
magic power. Suppose a man would call his shark, 'O Kuhai-moana
[the shark-god]! O, the One who lives in the Ocean!
Take me to the land!' Then perhaps a shark would appear,
and the man would get on the back of the shark, hold fast to
the fin, and say: 'You look ahead. Go on very swiftly without
waiting.' Then the shark would swim swiftly to the
shore."</p>

<p>The old Hawaiians had the sport called "lua." This sometimes
meant wrestling, but usually was the game of catching
a man, lifting him up, and breaking his body so that he was
killed. A wrestler of the lua class would go out to a plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
where no people were dwelling and call his god Kuialua.
The aumakua ghost-god would give this man strength and
skill, and help him to kill his adversaries.</p>

<p>There were many priests of different classes who prayed to
the ancestor-gods. Those of the farmers prayed like this:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O great black cloud in the far-off sky,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;O shadow watching shadow,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Watch over our land.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Overshadow our land<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From corner to corner<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From side to side.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Do not cast your shadow on other lands<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor let the waters fall on the other lands<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>i.e.</i>, keep the rains over my place]."<br />
</p>

<p>Also they prayed to Kane-puaa (Kane, the pig), the great
aumakua of farmers:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O Kane-puaa, root!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Dig inland, dig toward the sea;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Dig from corner to corner,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From side to side;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let the food grow in the middle,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Potatoes on the side roots,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Fruit in the centre.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Do not root in another place!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The people may strike you with the spade [o-o]<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Or hit you with a stone<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;And hurt you. Amama [Amen]."<br />
</p>

<p>So also they prayed to Kukea-olo-walu (a taro aumakua
god):</p>

<p>
&nbsp;    &nbsp;"O Kukea-olo-walu!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Make the taro grow,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Let the leaf spread like a banana.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Taro for us, O Kukea!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;The banana and the taro for us.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Pull up the taro for us, O Kukea!<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Pound the taro,<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Make the fire for cooking the pig.<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;Give life to us&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;To the farmers&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From sunrise to sunset<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;From one fastened place to the other fastened place<br />
&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>i.e.</i>, one side of the sky to the other fastened on each side of the earth]. Amama [Amen]."<br />
</p>

<p>Trees with their branches and fruit were frequently endowed
with spirit power. All the different kinds of birds
and even insects, and also the clouds and winds and the fish
in the seas were given a place among the spirits around the
Hawaiians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The people believed in life and its many forms of power.
They would pray to the unseen forces for life for themselves
and their friends, and for death to come on the families of
their enemies. They had special priests and incantations
for the pule-ana-ana, or praying to death, and even to the
present time the supposed power to pray to death is one of
the most formidable terrors to their imagination.</p>

<p>Menehunes, eepas, and kupuas were classes of fairies or
gnomes which did not belong to the ancestor-gods, or aumakuas.</p>

<p>The menehunes were fairy servants. Some of the Polynesian
Islands called the lowest class of servants "manahune."
The Hawaiians separated them almost entirely from the
spirits of ancestors. They worked at night performing
prodigious tasks which they were never supposed to touch
again after the coming of dawn.</p>

<p>The eepas were usually deformed and defective gnomes.
They suffered from all kinds of weakness, sometimes having
no bones and no more power to stand than a large leaf.
They were sometimes set apart as spirit caretakers of little
children. Nuuanu Valley was the home of a multitude of
eepas who had their temple on the western side of the
valley.</p>

<p>Kupuas were the demons of ghost-land. They were very
powerful and very destructive. No human being could
withstand their attacks unless specially endowed with
power from the gods. They had animal as well as human
bodies and could use whichever body seemed to be most
available. The dragons, or mo-os, were the most terrible
kupuas in the islands.</p>

<p class="center">THE DRAGON GHOST-GODS</p>

<p>Dragons were among the ghost-gods of the ancient
Hawaiians. These dragons were called mo-o. The New
Zealanders used the same names for some of their large reptile
gods. They, however, spelled the word with a "k," calling
it mo-ko, and it was almost identical in pronunciation as in
meaning with the Hawaiian name. Both the Hawaiians
and New Zealanders called all kinds of lizards mo-o or mo-ko;
and their use of this word in traditions showed that they
often had in mind animals like crocodiles and alligators, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
sometimes they referred the name to any monster of great
mythical powers belonging to a man-destroying class.</p>

<p>Mighty eels, immense sea-turtles, large fish of the ocean,
fierce sharks, were all called mo-o. The most ancient dragons
of the Hawaiians are spoken of as living in pools or lakes.
These dragons were known also as kupuas, or mysterious
characters who could appear as animals or human beings
according to their wish. The saying was: "Kupuas have a
strange double body."</p>

<p>There were many other kupuas besides those of the dragon
family. It was sometimes thought that at birth another
natural form was added, such as an egg of a fowl or a bird,
or the seed of a plant, or the embryo of some animal, which
when fully developed made a form which could be used as
readily as the human body. These kupuas were always
given some great magic power. They were wonderfully
strong and wise and skilful.</p>

<p>Usually the birth of a kupua, like the birth of a high chief,
was attended with strange disturbances in the heavens, such
as reverberating thunder, flashing lightning, and severe
storms which sent the abundant red soil of the islands down
the mountain-sides in blood-red torrents known as ka-ua-koko
(the blood rain). This name was also given to misty fine rain
when shot through by the red waves of the sun.</p>

<p>By far the largest class of kupuas was that of the dragons.
These all belonged to one family. Their ancestor was Mo-o-inanea
(The Self-reliant Dragon), who figured very prominently
in the Hawaiian legends of the most ancient times,
such as "The Maiden of the Golden Cloud."</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea (The Self-reliant Dragon) brought the
dragons, the kupua dragons, from the "Hidden Land of
Kane" to the Hawaiian Islands. Mo-o-inanea was apparently
a demi-goddess of higher power even than the gods
Ku, Kane, or Kanaloa. She was the great dragon-goddess
of the Hawaiians, coming to the islands in the migration
of the gods from Nuu-mea-lani and Kuai-he-lani to settle.
The dragons and other kupuas came as spirit servants of the
gods.</p>

<p>For a while this Mo-o-inanea lived with her brothers,
the gods, at Waolani, but after a long time there were so
many dragons that it was necessary to distribute them over
the islands, and Mo-o-inanea decided to leave her brothers
and find homes for her numerous family. So she went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to Puunui in the lower part of Nuuanu Valley and there
made her home, and it is said received worship from the
men of the ancient days. Here she dwelt in her dual nature&mdash;sometimes
appearing as a dragon, sometimes as a woman.</p>

<p>Very rich clayey soil was found in this place, forced out
of the earth as if by geyser action. It was greatly sought in
later years by the chiefs who worshipped this goddess. They
made the place tabu, and used the clay, sometimes eating it,
but generally plastering the hair with it. This place was made
very tabu by the late Queen Kaahumanu during her lifetime.</p>

<p>Mo-o-inanea lived in the pit from which this clay was
procured, a place called Lua-palolo, meaning pit-of-sticky-clay.
After she had come to this dwelling-place the dragons
were sent out to find homes. Some became chiefs and others
servants, and when by themselves were known as the evil
ones. She distributed her family over all the islands from
Hawaii to Niihau. Two of these dragon-women, according
to the legends, lived as guardians of the pali (precipice) at the
end of Nuuanu Valley, above Honolulu. After many years
it was supposed that they both assumed the permanent forms
of large stones which have never lost their associations with
mysterious, miraculous power.</p>

<p>Even as late as 1825, Mr. Bloxam, the chaplain of the
English man-of-war, recorded in "The Voyage of the Blonde"
the following statement:</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the Parre (pali) there are two large
stones on which even now offerings of fruits and flowers are
laid to propitiate the Aku-wahines, or goddesses, who are
supposed to have the power of granting a safe passage."</p>

<p>Mr. Bloxam says that these were a kind of mo-o, or reptile,
goddesses, and adds that it was difficult to explain the meaning
of the name given to them, probably because the Hawaiians
had nothing in the shape of serpents or large reptiles in their
islands.</p>

<p>A native account of these stones says: "There is a large
grove of hau-trees in Nuuanu Valley, and above these lie
the two forest women, Hau-ola and Ha-puu. These are now
two large stones, one being about three feet long with a fine
smooth back, the other round with some little rough places.
The long stone is on the seaward side, and this is the Mo-o
woman, Hau-ola; and the other, Ha-puu. The leaves of
ferns cover Hau-ola, being laid on that stone. On the other
stone, Ha-puu, are lehua flowers. These are kupuas."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the old people said that their ancestors had been
accustomed to bring the navel cords of their children and bury
them under these stones to insure protection of the little ones
from evil, and that these were the stone women of Nuuanu.</p>

<p>Ala-muki lived in the deep pools of the Waialua River
near the place Ka-mo-o-loa, which received its name from the
long journeys that dragon made over the plains of Waialua.
She and her descendants guarded the paths and sometimes
destroyed those who travelled that way.</p>

<p>One dragon lived in the Ewa lagoon, now known as Pearl
Harbor. This was Kane-kua-ana, who was said to have
brought the pipi (oysters) to Ewa. She was worshipped by
those who gathered the shell-fish. When the oysters began
to disappear about 1850, the natives said that the dragon
had become angry and was sending the oysters to Kahiki, or
some far-away foreign land.</p>

<p>Kilioe, Koe, and Milolii were noted dragons on the island
of Kauai. They were the dragons of the precipices of the
northern coast of this island, who took the body of the high
chief Lohiau and concealed it in a cave far up the steep side
of the mountain. There is a very long interesting story of
the love between Lohiau and Pele, the goddess of fire. In
this story Pele overcame the dragons and won the love of
the chief. Hiiaka, the sister of the fire-goddess, won a
second victory over them when she rescued a body from the
cave and brought it back to life.</p>

<p>On Maui, the greatest dragon of the island was Kiha-wahine.
The natives had the saying, "Kiha has mana, or
miraculous power, like Mo-o-inanea." She lived in a large
deep pool on the edge of the village Lahaina, and was worshipped
by the royal family of Maui as their special guardian.</p>

<p>There were many dragons of the island of Hawaii, and the
most noted of these were the two who lived in the Wailuku
River near Hilo. They were called "the moving boards"
which made a bridge across the river.</p>

<p>Sometimes they accepted offerings and permitted a safe
passage, and sometimes they tipped the passengers into the
water and drowned them. They were destroyed by Hiiaka.</p>

<p>Sacred to these dragons who were scattered over all the
islands were the mo-o priests and the sorcerers, who propitiated
them with offerings and sacrifices, chanting incantations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CHAS. R. BISHOP</p>

<p>Mr. Chas. R. Bishop died in California early in 1915,
having just passed his ninety-third birthday. He was born
in Glens Falls, N.Y., and sailed around Cape Horn to Hawaii
in the early days before steamship communication.</p>

<p>His wife, Pauahi, was a very high chiefess descended
from the royal line of Kamehameha the Great. To her
Kamehameha V. offered the throne, and on her refusal to
espouse him remained a bachelor and died without heir.
Mrs. Pauahi Bishop bequeathed her vast estate and fortune
to found the schools for Hawaiian boys and girls, known as
the Kamehameha Schools, Honolulu, and near these Mr.
Bishop founded the Bishop Museum; which contains all the
magnificent feather-cloaks, helmets, calabashes, etc., handed
down from generation to generation through the royal line of
the Kamehamehas and inherited by Mrs. Bishop. This has
been greatly increased by other gifts and purchases and now
forms the finest museum in the world, of relics of the Polynesian
race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>LEGENDS OF OLD HONOLULU. By William Drake
Westervelt. (Published July, 1915.) Press of Geo. H.
Ellis Co., Boston. 12mo. $1.50.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lovers of legendary lore may feast upon this collection of
traditional tales of the Hawaiian people and their origin as
first told by the old Hawaiians and sometimes touched up
and added to by the Hawaiian story-teller. The author
was president of the Hawaiian Historical Society for some
time, and is a resident of Honolulu. The tales found in
this handsomely illustrated volume have already for the
most part seen print in papers, magazines, and society reports,
and they are well worthy of preservation in this permanent
form. The legends tell of many things in heaven and on
earth, of the creation of man, the gods who found water,
the great dog Ku, the Cannibal Dog-man, the water of life
of Kane.&mdash;<i>Transcript, Boston, Mass., Aug. 11, 1915.</i></p>

<p>"Legends of Old Honolulu," collected and translated by
W. D. Westervelt, author of several other fine literary works, is
an interesting and fascinating volume in which we are told with
beauty of language and colorful description the weird and
mysterious folk-lore of these distant people who live in a
charmed atmosphere and whose life is one long summer day.</p>

<p>These legends have been gathered from Hawaiian traditions
by W. D. Westervelt, who resides in Honolulu, and who is
particularly equipped for giving them to the reading public.
They are illustrated with many sepia pictures taken from
original photographs, and these add greatly to the charm of
the book.</p>

<p>The author has not lost the simplicity of style in translation,
and this makes these tales all the more delightful.</p>

<p>"The Great Dog Ku" is captivating in its unusual depiction.
"The Wonderful Shell" is a veritable prose poem,
and there is magic and wonderful imagery about "Pikoi the
Rat-Killer" which will enthrall the youngsters and entertain
their elders. All these legends have their own particular
appeal, and this book may be classed among the rare offerings
of the year.&mdash;<i>Courier, Buffalo, N. Y., Aug. 29, 1915.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>W. D. Westervelt has produced a book of permanent and
world-wide interest in collecting and translating the legends
of old Honolulu which embody all that the vanishing race
knows of their origin and their life before the white man came
to civilize and decimate them. The legends are given their
proper setting by means of descriptive interludes and explanations
of native customs and a key to the language and its
pronunciation. No ethnologist, student of comparative religion,
or mythologist can afford to be ignorant of the material
collected by Mr. Westervelt and embodied in this well printed
and finely illustrated little volume.</p>

<p>Published by Geo. H. Ellis Co., Boston, Mass.&mdash;<i>Express,
Portland, Me., Sept. 4, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Westervelt has long been an active investigator of
the aboriginal conditions of Hawaiian life, and the stories he
has discovered have added not a little to our knowledge of
the Polynesian race as it was before the dawn of history.
The ancient Hawaiians were of an imaginative turn of mind,
and their traditions abound in tales of gods and goblins.
Some of the stories, now centuries old, are closely related
to the legends that are known to exist in New Zealand and
other islands of the Pacific, and many of them bear active
resemblances to the fairy-tales of our own country. They
are interesting enough in themselves, and have an added
attraction for the student of comparative folk-lore. The
present volume contains excellent illustrations of the scenery
of Honolulu, some of them taken from photographs by the
author.&mdash;<i>Scotsman, Great Britain, Sept. 13, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Westervelt, who gives us these legends of Polynesia,
has lived for many years in Honolulu, and has made a special
study of the history and traditions of the people of the islands.
He writes as one well versed in his subject, and some of the
legends which he presents to us are of great beauty, showing
a fine and delicate imagination in their authors.</p>

<p>The character of the legends varies. One or two, and
these perhaps the most interesting, are Creation myths.
It is evident here and there that the original web is crossed
with later strands which have obviously been introduced by
Christian missionary teaching, and it is not always easy to
disentangle them.</p>

<p>One, that has as primitive and antique a savour as any,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
is that of the Hog-god, Kamapuaa. It is a great tale, and
Kamapuaa was rather a glorious ruffian and capable of surprising
transformations.</p>

<p>"Many of the Hawaiians [he writes] of to-day believe
in the continual presence of the aumakuas, the spirits of the
dead. In time past the aumakuas were a powerful reality.
An ancester, a father or a grandfather, a makua, died. Sometimes
he went to Po, the under-world, or to Milu, the shadow-land,
or to Lani, the Hawaiian heaven, and sometimes he
remained to be a torment or a blessing to his past friends."</p>

<p>We could do well with more light thrown on these places,
pleasant or unpleasant, and on the ideas of the Polynesians
concerning the life after death. It seems that it would be
well within Mr. Westervelt's power and knowledge to give
us this further light, and we may hope that some day he will
do so.&mdash;<i>Times, London, Sept. 23, 1915.</i></p>

<p>Honolulu is fast becoming a favorite tourist land, and
particularly since the tremendous popularity of a recent
Hawaiian volcano play, a good many people have taken to
humming pensively the native farewell song and discoursing
wistfully of the Eden-like qualities of the islands. In view
of this increasing interest, W. D. Westervelt's book of the
legends of Honolulu is especially timely, although such a
work always has value. During his residence in Honolulu
this writer has collected and translated from the Hawaiian
all the available legends of the region, retelling them with
singular success.</p>

<p>To mention but an instance, every one of them has a tale
relating the creation of man. This haunting similarity is
one of the fascinations of legend study. Mr. Westervelt has
made a noteworthy contribution to that branch of literature.&mdash;<i>Bellman,
Minneapolis, Minn., Sept. 25, 1915.</i></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>These legends will prove of unusual interest to the general
reader and especially to the scholar, thinker, and poet. They
describe vividly and strongly the triumphs and the wanderings
of the people of Hawaii. The legends of old Honolulu
proper have been compiled from stories told by old Hawaiians
still living; others, furnished by the pioneer American missionaries,
who began their work on the islands early in the
last century. The writer has lived among this remnant of
a great race for many years, and through his sympathy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
deep appreciation of native hopes and native aspirations has
been able to familiarize himself with their inner life.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Legends of Old Honolulu" is an interesting summary of
what is known about the Hawaiian Islands, their people,
and the origin of their race.</p>

<p>As soon as the Hawaiian alphabet was prepared, in 1821,
native writers began delving into their past, finding there a
treasure-mine of romantic stories and of valuable ethnological
and historical facts in regard to the Polynesian race. These
stories were written originally in Hawaiian, for native news-papers,
and have been collected and translated by Mr. W. D.
Westervelt, author of previous volumes on this same subject.</p>

<p>While the book will be of special interest to students of
ethnology and to those who have visited Honolulu, the
romantic charm which pervades this Pacific archipelago
gives its history a universal attraction for the reading public.</p>

<p>The volume is well bound and well illustrated. Boston:

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
